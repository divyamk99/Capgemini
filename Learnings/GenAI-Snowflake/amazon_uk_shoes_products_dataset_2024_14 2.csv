"Klasified Women's Transparent Clear Sneaker Shoe, White, 5.5 UK",Love em,Love these. Was looking for converses and these were half the price and so unique— I’ve never seen clear shoes like these; they fit great. The plastic takes a little getting used to but the style is so worth it.,Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2020
"Klasified Women's Transparent Clear Sneaker Shoe, White, 5.5 UK",The plastic ripped,"The shoes are very cute, but after the 2nd day of wearing them the tongue started ripping. After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped. They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work. If you’re going to buy these I don’t recommend wearing them on days where you will do a lot of walking or they might rip",Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2021

"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",Perfect right outta the box,"True to size. If between I'd probably go with your lower end i.e 8-8.5 go 8. I wore these right out of the box for a little over 2 hours, most of which was walking around and they were incredibly comfortable no rubbing and I did not find any issue with the tongue being too stiff as I have seen mentioned in other reviews.",Reviewed in Canada on 20 October 2021
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",Disappointed,This is the second pair I bought. Loved the first pair however not pleased with the 2nd pair. There is no padding in the tongue part of the shoe and it is causing irritation to my skin where it rubs. I am very disappointed and will not buy them again.,Reviewed in Canada on 21 October 2021

"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",Comfortable and attractive,"I have hard to fit feet and often a wide fitting shoe looks too big and bulky.  These shoes were comfortable right away with no pressure points.  I use them for run around shoes, going to the store, etc.  They look casual but are more attractive than a running shoe.  They have a nice rounded toe box and go with any kind of outfit.  I am very happy with them.",Reviewed in Canada on 8 October 2018
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",かわいいけど、色々残念,足が22cmのため、このサイズを展開しているブランドが少なく購入。デザインは可愛くて満足だが、履き心地は残念。小さいサイズあるあるで、パーツは大きいサイズのものを流用しているように思える。・ベロが長すぎて、足首を曲げるたびにこすれて、すり傷ができる（スニーカーソックスではNG）・インソールの踵から土踏まずのアーチまでの距離が長すぎて、つま先寄りにアーチが来るため、後ろ重心に感じる今回は靴下や中敷きを工夫して履こうと思うが、可愛くてもリピートはしない。,Reviewed in Japan on 10 December 2021
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot,"I really need 11 1/2 but these shoes do not come in half sizes.  My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot.  The only issue is the blue insole - my feet perspire and the blue colour runs into my socks.  Also, the round laces look nice but they do not remain tied; they need a knot in the bow to maintain the tie.  They are very attractive shoes and do not look huge in size 12. Thank you.

"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",Great quality and comfort shoes,Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that weren’t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.,Reviewed in the United States on 27 August 2020
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",NO SUPPORT! NOT FOR RUNNING!,I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 July 2020
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",Not as supportive as I had hoped for.,"These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn't want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I'm returning them.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 May 2016
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",Great pair of shoes!,"Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big. But, that doesn't take away from the comfort. I'm not sliding around inside them. I'm able to work in them well and workout in them great. Excellent pair of shoes.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2020
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",Can’t wear due to Poorly designed insoles,"I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 October 2018
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",Tongue rubs ankles raw,"The tongue is long, stiff, and rough. It rubs my ankles raw.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 April 2021
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",What I was looking for,"I have been trying to find a casual, but not too casual, shoe for work. I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesn't look like an athletic shoe. This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with ""dress"" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well. I think this is good brand.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 June 2019
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",Not for slippery surfaces/no tread,I thought they were really cute and fit good but after I decided to wear them around for a day I mopped the floor like I Do every day and I almost slipped so the shoes will not be good for me and my lifestyle very slippery pretty much no tread it would be good for walking as long as you’re never honest with Service but I wouldn’t want to take my chances so back to Searching for a new pair of shoes,Reviewed in the United States on 10 July 2021
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up ...,"I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it's not all the time, but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don't seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don't, the original inserts are pretty good",Reviewed in the United States on 1 May 2017
"adidas Women's Retrorun Shoes Running, Core Black/Cloud White/Alumina, 8 UK",Super cuter sneakers.,I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though. I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute. Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens. I have a little more space than I like to have. Otherwise completely awesome!,Reviewed in the United States on 6 January 2021
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK","Cute, but small","I was so excited to find these shoes. They are super cute!  They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.  When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight.  Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them, but they just didn't fit.  I am disappointed that I can't find the size I need anywhere, but will keep looking.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 November 2020
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",Nice lightweight comfort shoe,"It's a very comfortable and lightweight shoe.  I found it to be pretty true for a size 10, but all shoes run differently.  Other reviews said it ran small, but I didn't find that the case. I bought the 10D width.  The wider width doesn't look odd, it fits the shoe well and my foot.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 August 2016
"Aravon Women's Betty-AR Oxfords, Stone, 5.5 UK",Total Comfort,Two years ago I bought this same exact shoes.  I wore them always when choosing a stylish athletic shoe. Originally I bought them when our family was going to go to The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing alot of walking.there has never been a time that my feet hurt when I wear these shoes. And I get compliments often as to how cute they look.  So best shoes for me for comfort and style!

"adidas Daily 3.0 Skate Shoe, Grey, 3 US Unisex Little Kid",Thank you!,"These shoes are cute and jus fine. I wanted to comment on the company actually. I bought these for a wedding for my son to wear and they weren’t going to arrive in time.  I reached out to Amazon with no luck. I finally contacted the company directly and they said they didn’t think they could get them to me in time because of how the process works. However, I literally received these the very next day.

"adidas Daily 3.0 Skate Shoe, Grey, 3 US Unisex Little Kid",Great shoe - great price - runs big,"Great looking shoe at a great price! I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes. Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were $20 more. They run big. I wear a women’s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didn’t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. They’re big. I measured them against the men’s 7 I had from the store and there wasn’t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the men’s 6.5 I had from the store. I would’ve ordered a 5 if they were available. It’s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation. Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 November 2021

Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Sehr gute Winterstiefel!,Mein 4- jähriger Sohn liebt diese Stiefel und möchte seine anderen Schuhe nicht mehr tragen. Er hat in den Stiefeln keine Schweißfüße wie in einigen anderen Schuhen. Er läuft sehr gut  darin und hat auch bei eisigen Temperaturen keine kalten Füße. Die Stiefel sind meiner Meinung nach von einer sehr guten Qualität und deshalb etwas schwerer. Meinen Sohn stört das überhaupt nicht. Er kommt perfekt rein und wieder raus (das war bei anderen Stiefeln problematischer). Das Highlight für ihn ist natürlich das blinken. Ich werde die Stiefel auch wohl im nächsten Winter kaufen.,Reviewed in Germany on 10 January 2018
Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Perfekt auch für etwas breitere Kinderfüße,"Beck Gummistiefel begleiten uns nun schon einige Jahre.

Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust: Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut überstanden! Sie halten warm und trocken. Es stimmt, dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel, aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestört oder beim Laufen behindert. Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben... auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie, wenn sie noch ganz neu sind.",Reviewed in Germany on 15 January 2020
Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Schöner Jungen Stiefel,Die Gummistiefel sind sehr schön verarbeitet und unser Sohn liebt sie.

Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schön und perfekt für alle Dinofans. Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen, was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann. Der Stiefel fällt etwas groß aus.

Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Quality design has been exchanged for quick profit. Sorry I gotta move on to a new brand.,"I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2021
Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Just a really comfortable Boot..,"I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought I’d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. I’ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot I’ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, that’s unheard of and if you’re a Boot Person you know what I’m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. I’m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and I’m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I can’t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didn’t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis",Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2020
Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,super nice but heel fits weird,"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer.",Reviewed in the United States on 19 September 2021
Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Update: Comfy if you can get them on.,I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.  Too bad.,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2020
Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,"If You're Considering These Boots, BUY THEM!","I've owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots. Yes, I'm a big fan of them. I enjoy wearing Western-styled clothes and boots. I'm also a truck driver, and a biker. These boots fit the bill for all of these. Right out of the box, they look great, and are very comfortable. I wear a 12D. I ordered a 12D, and the fit is spot on. No problems at the heel, arch, or toe. They're listed as Waterproof. Haven't put that to the test yet. They're not as heavy as I thought they'd be. Very nice boot, easy to get used to, and looks great. I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey, to condition the leather, and give them some extra protection. All in all, a great boot. I have no issues with them. They're Dan Post boots---great boots, great quality, and great looks. As I titled this review, if you're considering these boots, buy them. A great all around boot. Lastly, I've read reviews, mentioning that they're made in China. Yes, unfortunately, mine say it, too. Really sad.",Reviewed in the United States on 20 November 2021
Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Best Pair Of Boots I've Ever Owned - Seam plastic piping is the weak point,"I've owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day.  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out. That's the only weak point and I think it's the piping that causes the failure.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 February 2019

I didn't open them right away, so I did a few days ago only to find that they fit about half a size big, and they feel like they're a wide width.

I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop.  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh, flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff.  As a replacement shoe, New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe. This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on.  It is stiff, it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 November 2018

Also, the ""fit and finish"" of these shoes is highly disappointing -  the way the tongue is sewn into the shoe leaves a lot to be desired and the extra fabric inside the shoe rubs your feet. Finally, the plastic edge where the lace holes sit is extremely rigid and this same plastic edge also affects the front of your foot when tied.Am definitely returning and looking for a better solution.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 March 2020

"New Balance Men's Arishi V2 Fresh Foam Running Shoe, Navy/Red, 7 UK",U Get What U Pay For,"You get what u pay for. Decent for the price. Very basic shoe. If you want a neutral shoe which u can use for commute as sneaker and use it for ocassional short distance run then it might suit u. Cushioning is provided by fresh foam which is decent but not as plush. Not much of a tech goes into it. Like it doesn't have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing. No extra layers of protection, in terms of cushioning in the sole. Laces are just basic. Build quality is ok but not great. Not suitable for broad feet. Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe. Waverider 19 is still the most value for money product here in India. Gel Nimbus are bit expensive.

It’s tight mid-foot because of some band on the top but it’s actually loose in the toe box. When shoes fit this bad, I just can not recommend them for anything. Not for basketball, not for working out, not even for walking. Adidas is a great brand but they made a mistake with these shoes.

adidas Mens Marquee Boost Low White Size: 10.5 UK,almost zero cushioning- what you see is not what you get,"First, these are good looking shoes, they fit pretty well, and the sole has pretty good grip.  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion.  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning.  Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 June 2020

The Adidas ""boost"" on these are the best cushion I've ever felt to date. They feel really good when walking or running because you can feel the energy returned to your feet from the boost cushion. I want these shoes in a couple of different color-ways and the 3/4 or high top versions. I like the various different textiles/textures. The thick collar around the ankle & achilles looks kinda weird, but I'm used to it & like it now.

"New Balance Unisex Adults’ MCH796PD Industrial Shoe, Amarillo, 4 UK",Absolutely love them!,"Ok, so normally New Balance shoes run a little small. My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 11.5 4E width. That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feel.When I usually purchase New Balance shoes, I get size 12 4E. Even then, its can be slightly short, but tolerable.  With these shoes, I started with the 12 4E. But man do they run long. The width seemed to be pretty accurate though.So I went with the 11.5 4E instead. They fit almost perfectly, except MAYBE a little long in the toes. However, I believe it were a size down, it would be a little too short.These are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts. I've easily put on about 20 hours of play on them, and they barely have any wear.

"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK","Lightweight, supportive, waterproof - LOVE!!","After measuring my foot, following the size chart and ordering a 7, I could barely fit my foot in the shoe. Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I've NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I'm wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a ""test walk"" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I've gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I've owned. I love that the design is not TOO overly ""outdoorsy"" looking and doesn't have a lot of extra straps in the design (ie. keen or LL Bean  boots).Buy these boots and you won't be sorry!!",Reviewed in the United States on 17 May 2019
"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK",Avoid buying the boots on Amazon!  Maybe avoid in general!!!,"Don’t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.  It was a fight, but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 January 2020
"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK",Great shoe but runs very small!,"Just received bought the eggplant I love this show. Not hiked in it yet though. It has a high arch support, and a padded super comfy heap. So for people with heal pain great shoe. My normal size is 8.5, I ordered a 9 based on reviews that it runs small. Well I now need a 9.5 so asking seller if they will exchange. This is not a shoe for a wide footed person but if you are a regular Vasque purchaser you will know that. I would have given 5 stars but for the hassle of having to exchange and hope I don’t get charged extra because shoe runs small!",Reviewed in the United States on 11 December 2019
"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK",Great for farming. Light weight and versatile,"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, they’ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, I’ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when I’m wearing my summer weight socks, I’m not get boiling hot feet. So that’s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to “go” in my work boots.So far, they’ve been worth the investment! We will see in a few months how they actually hold up to eastern PA farming.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2021
"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK","Beautiful, well-made, but 100% FLAWED for hiking!","I want to love these shoes, but there's one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me. I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down! All that time an money for product development, I'm surprised that this got overlooked. It's a bummer, because these would otherwise be great shoes! If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces, then these would be fine.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2021
"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK",Best hiking shoe ever,"The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my foot’s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If you’re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these “too small”.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isn’t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary “feet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much I’m buying a second pair incase they’re discontinued.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2021
"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK","Not a boot, it is a overly flexible shoe...","I have been using Vasque boots for over 20 years with great satisfaction.  Specially the Breeze series that is an exceptional combination between comfort, support and lightweight for hiking in hot weather.These shoes are exceptionally light but offer almost no support.  They are fresh foam based and overly flexible.

I either got used to them or they did seem to break without discomfort. That first time I realized I could run in them too!. I use these to run on hiking trails and my feet and legs don't get tired. I love these boots/trail runners. FYI, they have a 6mm heel to toe drop.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 May 2020

"Vasque Women's Breeze LT Low GTX Gore-Tex Waterproof Breathable Hiking Shoe, Eggplant/Anthracite, 5.5 UK","Amazing, so happy","I’m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping they’d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldn’t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i don’t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know they’re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9’s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured I’d mention it. I love wearing these and didn’t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet. These boots are absolutely outstanding, so comfortable, supportive and waterproof...my only gripe is the treads are so good that it’s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards...",Reviewed in the United States on 21 October 2020

They were comfortable around foot, gave a little bounce back when I walked and great ankle support. I will say if you have a wider foot, this is not for you.

Svolgono egregiamente la loro funzione: hanno un buon grip,  sono carine, sono leggere, non molto traspiranti a mio parere, hanno l'aria abbastanza sintetica, ma per il prezzo pagato sono un'ottima alternativa.

PUMA Women's Suede Platform Trace Olive Night 8 B US,way worse than i was expecting,"These are the most ill-fitting Pumas ive ever had. And the laces are more like ribbons than actually shoelaces. I have wider feet but that was never a problem with any other Pumas i've had. I had just got some similar orange platform ones and they were the best ever, these were the worst. Way too tight. i thought it was just me at first but then i didnt wear them for a while, and nothing else hurt my feet. Then i just thought i'd need to break them in, but i walked 10 painful miles at least in them over the past two months and my feet still hurt from wearing them two days ago. Nice color but shitty laces and too narrow.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 October 2019
PUMA Women's Suede Platform Trace Olive Night 8 B US,Pumas rock!!!!,Firstly the package when getting these shoes  is phenomenal. IT is a box within another box. Very secure. Open feeling the shoes you notice it's great quality. You can feel the laces are a step up from regular laces. I usually wear 9 but got a 9 1/2 due to shoes being a little narrow due to passed experiences. But the shoe fits to perfection and I got black to use more often . I absolutely love them ! Super nice and the platform helps with confidence and it's slightly curved but it works well for back.,Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2019
PUMA Women's Suede Platform Trace Olive Night 8 B US,Don’t know what to say,"Don’t know how to say, can’t tell it’s true or fake product , that’s why gave 4 stars, but it’s heavier than regular sneakers, it makes you look cool whatever style you are in, and color is way light than in the display picture, overall just wearing a regular branded sneaker which don’t know true or fake.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 January 2020
PUMA Women's Suede Platform Trace Olive Night 8 B US,Cute bricks,"These shoes are adorable and the touches like the suede and ribbon laces make them stand out without being obnoxious. But the platform is made of concrete, I think? At least, it feels like I'm walking with bricks on my feet. There's no flex at all and zero cushion. I'd say buy a size up and put an insert in, but they run kind of big, and even an insert wouldn't make up for the fact that the shoes will not allow your foot to bend at all.",Reviewed in the United States on 31 October 2019
PUMA Women's Suede Platform Trace Olive Night 8 B US,Warning,"I gave these shoes a three star because they are stylish and fit. However they are extremely uncomfortable to walk in. The built in insole feels like its designed to make your feet hurt. It would be fine If you could remove the insole it comes with but not only is it sewn in, its glued in as well, so to try and take it out your self would ruin the shoe. if you really want the shoe. Buy a size up and put a thick insole in and that will solve the problem. If you don't feel like going through that don't get the shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 May 2020

After reading the reviews, I ordered a 10.5 and I could not be happier! I love the look of these shoes. I removed the laces. Since the shoe fits like a sock and I don't plan on running in them, I didn't really see a point of having the laces there. Plus they kinda rubbed my foot in a weird way. They feel absolutely perfect without laces. I have a rather narrow foot. If you have a wide foot, I don't think you would find this shoe to your liking. The grey color is perfect for me and I love the little splashes on the tread at the side. I also love the weave look of the shoe.

"Mammut Ducan GTX Shoes Men Olive Shoe Size UK 10,5 | EU 45 1/3 2019","Lovely, but...","This shoe is well built, one of the best looking hiking shoes I came across, above average quality and really slick design. It's a bit heavy, but it's a waterproof (GORE-TEX) hiking shoe with thick sole, so it's expected.Unfortunately, did not work for me.  Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable. To add insult to injury (no pun intended, although I can easily imagine injuries at pressure points after long hikes), it really cuts bad into the foot just proximal to the toes, and only one shoe. Virtually impossible to walk without discomfort. Sadly, no matter how much I liked them, had to return.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 March 2020

Ho fatto così anche in questo caso e mi sono trovato bene.  È inutile girarci intorno, non si può dare una regola precisa perché dipende dalla forma del vostro piede. In questo caso trattandosi di stivaletti dovete tenere presente che se avete le caviglie grandi potrebbe essere un problema il numero in meno e allora conviene il vostro numero usuale.MATERIALILa pelle è sempre di buona qualità. Gli stivali non sono lucidi ma piuttosto opachi quindi se vi piace la pelle lucida optate per altri modelli. A me piacciono così.CONCLUSIONIBuon prodotto. Grazie alla scuola Geox che lascia respirare il piede si sta bene e non si suda, cosa difficile con altri tipi di stivaletti. Acquisto consigliato soprattutto in offerta intorno ai 50 euro!

"New Balance - Boys KVARNV1Y Shoes, 13.5W UK Junior, Pigment/Ice Blue","Terrible unadjustable, fixed laces!","These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I've been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products. BUT, I will absolutely make sure I never purchase sneakers with unadjustable, fixed laces again!",Reviewed in the United States on 4 January 2019

It does not require the kids to tie (faster for kids to put on), comfort fit, great colors and design, no snagging on the tongue of shoes nor does it elastic on the “laces” become loose!

My son has fairly narrow feet but after wearing these 1 or 2 times he told me they weren't comfortable and pointed to the end of the 'laces' as hurting.I believe the problem is that the elastic ""laces"" don't adjust very much.  I was able to pull the elastic out there and make a little bit of an adjustment so hopefully we can get SOME wear out of them...wish I could return them though.If your child has wider feet, as mine always have been, you shouldn't even consider this product.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 August 2019

The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and that’s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great. Without the insoles, I would have had to return them.",Reviewed in the United States on 27 June 2020

"adidas Women's Cloudfoam Pure Running Shoe, Black/Black/White, 8 UK",Comfy From Day One for My Hard to Fit Feet,"I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes.

Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Guter Schuh,"Man sollte allerdings auf die Größe achten er fällte sehr groß aus, besser eine Nummer größer kaufen,",Reviewed in Germany on 20 March 2021
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,More athletic Hiker than the Moab 2s,"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2020
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Less than 100 miles and threads are coming out,"The threads are showing on both toe covers in under 100 miles.  I've been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks, which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day.  I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2020
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Not a shoe everyone would like but perfect for my feet,"First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy men's shoes to get the width I need.  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.  In this shoe a men's 7 wide was perfect.  No, you won't get the Vibram sole, but comfort was more important to me than the sole material.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 June 2020
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Don't waste your money!,"Total disappointment; you certainly don't get what you pay for ($80.00) with these.  Merrell is supposed to be a good name with a good reputation for quality shoes, but unfortunately it hasn't been my experience with the last to pairs of hiking shoes I've purchased of theirs.I had these barely 4 months and both heels already had holes worn through the sole.  See attached pics.  Merrell minimizing material costs by reducing the thickness of the sole is just unacceptable for an $80.00 shoe.I certainly won't be purchasing Merrell any longer....Columbia are on my radar now.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 March 2021
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Great shoe but size seems smaller that usual.,"Delivery was on time and no damages. As with all the other Merrell footwear I have purchased, these shoes are of the quality I expect from them. This is first time I have ordered Merrell products on Amazon, so not sure if that is the reason for my issue. I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future. I paid the same on Amazon as Merrell's website, and the fit is not the same as I expect. Tried to save a few dollars and screwed myself.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 March 2021
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Happy with my first pair of Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes,"I have had a pair of Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes that I use almost daily for my walking regiment and I have also used them twice walking sections of the Appalacian Trial and they have worn like iron. The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them. It's like they were already ""broken-in"" and I don't get any blisters or sore areas on my feet or heels from using them new right out of the box.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2021
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,About half size smaller the actual size and too narrow,"Updating my review (below) after I've been wearing these shoes for about two weeks.In addition to being smaller than the actual size and too narrow, they do not have much cushioning, which causes some heel pain after a long walk. I would return them but my guess it is too late.Previous review:These are indeed fine-looking shoes, comfortable and cushy. Hopefully, they will serve me well.On the downside, they are not exactly true to size: size 11 actually feels like 10.5. Also, they are moderately uneven: left shoe looks somewhat narrower and slightly curved toward the inside.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 October 2021
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,Buy a pair of moabs.,"From my personal experience these don't even come close to moabs. Tried them hoping to get a good pair of Merrills for less then what I was used to spending.  I regret the decision. While they fit well enough, and have plenty of space. They don't provide the same support. 2 months in and my feet hurt walking in them for extended periods of time. It took my last pair of moabs well over a year to get to this point.  Unfortunately I'll end up buying a new pair of shoes much sooner then expected because I tried to save a few bucks.",Reviewed in the United States on 24 December 2020
Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,I ordered these in a wide but could have gotten by with regular,I ordered these in a wide since I've been having issues with other shoe manufacturers being too small and tight but I could have gotten by with the standard width. I will continue to by Merrell shoes since they last forever and their shoe size fits as expected.,Reviewed in the United States on 4 January 2020

I figure women can automatically grow 3 inches taller with high heels, why can't guys try it?Well it did work with the height jump.  It's amazing feeling walking in a public place and all of the sudden looking down more on people's heads.  The only downside it they begin to hurt your feet after an hour or so.  It's not horrible and maybe that's what women deal w/ via high heels.  But if there was a way around this it would be nice.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 March 2020

Buen soporte en el talón, buen ajuste gracias a los cordones y añadir que es un pie de gato con horma estrecha, por lo que a mi concretamente me han encajado a la perfección para mis pies estrechos.Como recomendación para iniciación comprar vuestra talla que soléis utilizar en calzado normal sino estáis habituados a llevar el pie apretado, una más en un par de meses notaréis el pie demasiado flojo y os dará desconfianza. Son de piel y estiran.Para orientaros porque no encontraba tabla exacta con cms yo pedí 3 tallas diferentes para comparar y ver qué necesitaba la 36 2/3 son 23cm, 37 1/3 son 23,5 y la 38 son 23,7.Espero que os sirva de ayuda y referencia.",Reviewed in Spain on 24 September 2021

"Brooks Men's Hyperion Tempo Running Shoe, Black/Silver/White, 6 UK",Ein klasse Laufschuh von Brooks - vom Daily Trainer bis zum Wettkampfschuh,"Ich habe inzwischen 150km im Hyperion Tempo absolviert. Vom 7km Fartlek, 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75% Pace - der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur. Das Zusammenspiel von Dämpfung, Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend. Doch der Reihe nach:Gewicht: Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht, er fühlt sich auch genauso an und läuft sich, besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut. Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend Dämpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts geht.Dämpfung: Für reine Versenläufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl, für Mittelfußläufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super. Die Dämpfung ist ausreichend, man spürt die Energierückgewinnung, wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem Carbon-Schuh (kostet auch wesentlich weniger).Feedback: Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dünn, aber sie gibt viel Feedback. So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewöhnungsbedürftig. Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine Stärken aus. Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der Außensohle zu sehen.Die Schnürsenkel sind sehr dünn und dürften etwas kürzer sein, selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu lange.Alles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks - mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lässt und man lange (+650km) Spaß haben kann.Sofern die Rezension hilfreich war, freue ich mich über ein Daumen nach oben ;-)",Reviewed in Germany on 26 July 2021

But these shoes I made an exception because of the style, I love it. Very uncomfortable, at first but now after several wears and washes, the shoes seem to be more tolerable.

They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn't take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the ""fit"" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn't the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on. I can see my toes very easily. So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking. It looks very odd.

This was my first time trying women's puma shoes do I didn’t really know what to expect and had to return these.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 October 2021

"Reebok Women's Classic Harman Ripple Double Sneaker, Porcelain/Pixel Pink/White, 6 UK",Lumpy under ball of foot and toe area too pointy,"Why are athletic shoe companies putting these weird things under the soul? Is it supposed to be a gel pad or what? Instead of making the shoe more comfortable, it makes the shoe less comfortable. Please, just give us a nice smooth insole. . Don’t put these gel pads in there because they don’t work and we can feel them so it defeats the purpose.  If it’s not a gel pad I don’t know what it is. But it’s a horizontal lump going from left to right under the ball of the foot area. Also I don’t like the toe area, too pointy, prefer more rounded.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 June 2020

"Florsheim Kids Baby Boy&#39;s Great Lakes Sport Slip, Jr. (Toddler/Little Kid/Big Kid)",High quality nice shoes for kids,"These are a little fancier than I would send my kid to school in.They are more like a fancy occasion, Sunday church, holiday, or just an “I can’t find my sneakers” day (it happens).I was anxious about the “slip on” as sometimes this style is actually harder to get on kid’s limp feet as they don’t tend to push their foot in to help you out at all when trying to get the shoes on. I was surprised that my kid could actually get these on all by himself and without any socks to ease the way to boot. I’m pleased that the elastic panels built in actually stretch enough so the kids can get their foot in.The quality of these is really good. They look and feel like a high quality men’s shoe, just in a mini me, kid’s size. This is a great shoe to match Dad in.My kid was so excited about his new shoes he ran errands around town in them the day he got them.Can’t wait for him to wear these to picture day, etc.Overall I’d recommend them.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2020

Very well made, durable child shoe.  My child feels comfortable in them and has never complained about wearing them (he would be barefoot all the time if that were an option).

Yo suelo usar 39-40 EU en general (mi pie mide 26 cm. y es ancho) y aquí me pedí 38,5 y aún me sobra quizás algo más incluso llevando calcetín (no media). El modelo es JUNIOR. No es ni de hombre ni de mujer. Pero si tienes pie que no pasas del 40 EU habitual puedes optar por comprar zapatillas de modelo JUNIOR. El tallaje que viene es 6 USA - 38,5 EU - 24 cm. En las Chuck Taylor de mujer uso 7,5 USA -38 EU - 24 cm. Me guie por la medida de cm. para ver si acertaba y parece ser que sí.",Reviewed in Spain on 20 November 2020

Very NARROW WIDTH, and the fit is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Pretty disappointing.

I ordered my normal size, 8 1/2, and couldn't even get my heel in the shoe. So I ordered a size 9. Though I could get my foot in the shoes, they were so narrow they hurt. This is the first product I've bought from Minnetonka that was so narrow. All their other shoes have run true to the width indicated. If you have narrower feet, these are for you!

adidas Women&#39;s Distancestar,Only run on Tracks!,"I like this running shoe.  I ran a virtual 10K road race and ran a pretty good time in them.  However, the metal spikes needed to be replaced after one 10K road race.  You should only run in this shoe on a Track (rubber or synthetic).  I wish the manufacturer would have specified that in that I nearly destroyed the shoe running on concrete and streets.  There is plastic grip teeth that were ruined.  Also, if you are a distance runner buy lots of metal spikes, the spikes will wear after run like a 10K.  Oh yeah running in the rain no problem, the shoe itself does not absorb water like trainers, but your feet will get wet.  For the price I paid, under $40.00 not a bad purchase.  I am going to buy another pair.",Reviewed in the United States on 20 October 2020

First pair of Skechers and I'm in love.  I have wide feet and my left foot is half a size bigger than my right, so I usually can't just buy shoes without trying them first.  I intended these to be personal shoes to use when I go out of the house with the family but don't want to wear running shoes.  But I've found myself bringing them to work because they look very professional and at the same time feel very comfortable.  I get about 12,000 steps a day when I'm at work so these have been amazing feet savers.  I even used them to teach a dance class and forgot that I wasn't wearing my dance shoes because they didn't stick to the wooden floors like basketball shoes yet have much more comfort than formal dance shoes.  I'm definitely getting another pair.",Reviewed in the United States on 31 October 2019

My sneaker size is 9.5 but I ordered a 10 in this shoe and it fits just right.  The memory foam is perfect as I work in a retail environment and am on my feet many hours a day.  The casual loafer style also fits my work environment. I am very happy I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes and will probably buy more in different colors. The price here can't be beat. I purchased another set of ""memory foam"" loafers at a local payless chain and for $10 more than what I paid for these Sketchers they are not even close in comfort.

They are very light and they have the very comfortable memory foam insole. I have a relatively high instep, so loafers do not always work well for me. These are surprisingly comfortable. Oddly enough, they are more comfortable to walk around in than they are to wear while sitting (high instep thing ... I guess). The material seems to breath better, my feet to not get as hot as they would with other shoes. The quality of the materials and of the construction is top notch.

Chaco Scion Women 7,Almost perfect,"I’m searching for a cute yet quality shoe for a trip to Barcelona in fall.  This shoe was almost perfect.  Its really very pretty (I got the wine color).  It’s very comfortable, and the material has a lot of stretch and give— comfortable out of the box.  The only uncomfortable part was that my big toe rubbed on the top of the shoe.  Not the end— they were the right size— but the top, which bothered me while I walked.  If you’re thinking about these, definitely give them a try though.",Reviewed in the United States on 24 July 2019

They have the arch support I've come to expect with chacos and are as lightweight as my off duty slide on sketchers. As long as they turn out to be as durable as my sandals these will be a phenomenal purchase.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 December 2019
Chaco Scion Women 7,Excellent arch support and comfy.,The only thing I dislike is that the padding on the upper part of the back of the shoe is not enough.

Like other reviews,on one heel it rubbed and the opposite foot it rubbed pinky toe with socks on, irritating! Just have to break-in. I go through ""work shoes""/inserts about 6 months.  On a side note, didn't appreciate the UPS man just throwing the package on porch! Just because no car doesn't mean no one home and watching.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 March 2020
Chaco Scion Women 7,I highly recommend these shoes!! I’ve ordered multiple pairs.,"I absolutely love these shoes!I’ve ordered 2 pairs so far. Some of my favorite things about this shoe is that there’s little to no need to “break in” the shoe, they fit my wide feet very comfortably, they are very sturdy, and they are very comfortable and I can walk for miles and not get blisters! I mainly wear them for work. I work in a kitchen as a waitress and these do an amazing job. They grip well on slick surfaces, I just wouldn’t run on the slick surfaces. My last pair lasted me just shy of a year, but I did wear them pretty much everyday walking anywhere from 4-6+ miles a day give or take. They are also great for most  hiking endeavors.I highly recommend these shoes if you’re looking for a light hiking shoe or a gripping work shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2020

"adidas unisex-child Racer TR 2.0,Ink/Copper/pink tint,12.5 M US",If you want a good quality shoe. Buy these.,"Perfect. I let my daughter pick. I ordered a 1/2 size up as recommended. I probably could of gone a full size up. But my daughter has a narrow foot and I was afraid her foot would “flop out”. So we will pay the extra and go up a size as needed. If your child as a more average size foot, I would say you could size up at least 1/2-full size if they are on the cusp of that growth spurt. If your child has a wide foot, I do not recommend these shoes. Again-this is MY OPINION. I feel has been very fair and honest.",Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2020

"adidas unisex-child Racer TR 2.0,Ink/Copper/pink tint,12.5 M US",Toe end began fraying after just a couple months of wear.,"My son was excited for these shoes. Unlike others, I WAS looking for velcro, because although he knows how to tie his shoes, he would rather slip them on and off, and I would rather still have a decent, rather then broken heel of his shoe. Turns out the heel was not the problem!! Instead, the toe part (it is cloth-woven on top of a more solid base) of the shoe began to unravel a couple months into wear, and now it looks completely frayed (over an inch or so) and tacky, revealing the plastic form of the shoe underneath. Otherwise the shoe has held up great, the white part in the front is fine, the tread on the bottom, it fits, he loves it, etc, but he will be getting a new pair of a DIFFERENT shoe, because I am not taking my chances on this pair again.",Reviewed in the United States on 14 April 2021

They tend to run slightly bigger and more true to size than Nike, which run small, and are better quality than UA which tend to wear quickly and have color wear off.  The Adidas are really the best if both Nike and UA with sizing and quality.  These are lightweight, attractive and fit well.

I purchased these because of all of the reviews noting these had great arch support. I have one question.....Where is said arch support? If you are expecting a decent amount of arch support (like a Vionic shoe) - this is NOT it. The insole has a bit of bump - else it's pretty flat without a lot of padding.

"New Balance Men's All Coast 425 V1 Sneaker, Navy/Natural Indigo, 11",Sizing is way off.,The sizing of these is way off. I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit? I give up.  I wouldn't recommend ordering these online unless you know for a fact what size is appropriate. Try these on first if at all possible.,Reviewed in the United States on 31 December 2020
"New Balance Men's All Coast 425 V1 Sneaker, Navy/Natural Indigo, 11",Would not recommend people who skate every once and a while,"I purchased these shoes a little under 2 weeks ago and am not impressed with the durability of the stitching on them. I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks, an Ollie and kickflip if I’m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them. My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all. They are also not comfortable in the slightest, even after wearing them in a good bit. Maybe I got a bad batch but if not, do better New Balance.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 October 2021
"New Balance Men's All Coast 425 V1 Sneaker, Navy/Natural Indigo, 11",Only a Little Wider (2E not 4E),"I ordered the 11.5 Wide, since New Balance has been exceptionally consistent in sizing for me. To my surprise, these did not fit when I tried them on. The reason is they're not the standard 4E wide for New Balance, but only 2E wide. I tried two of these before realizing the problem. They look great, but if you're buying it for the width, be sure to know they're not standard wides.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 March 2020

"New Balance Men's All Coast 425 V1 Sneaker, Navy/Natural Indigo, 11","Fit well, look nice",I didn’t even know that New Balance made skate style shoes. These shoes look nice and feel great. The only thing I am not a fan of is the big “N” sticked on the side. Branding is branding... oh well. The shoes breathe and help keep the feet from getting a serious case of the stankfoot.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2019
"New Balance Men's All Coast 425 V1 Sneaker, Navy/Natural Indigo, 11",Fits tighter than similarly sized New Balance shoes,"I should have paid closer attention to the reviews!  I have purchased several New Balance shoes and these 9.5W are tighter than past pairs.  I have been thinking that the material will break in over time; however, the tightness is around the panels that secure the sides/laces.  That firm material doesn't seem to have much give and it immediately aches.  Other than, the shoe is well constructed.  I'm disappointed I will have to return the shoes for a 10W.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2019

Reebok Kids' Yourflex Train 10 Sneaker,Been buying Reebok for the last 5 years,"I have two wild boys whom are 7 and 10.  They love gym and are always involved in at least one sport per season.  They are very hard on shoes because they live to run and jump.  We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair.  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it.  Please bring those shoes back.  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever since.I bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class.  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each.  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance, but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendously.I've seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic.  In the future, I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this.  I'm disappointed Reebok.  I've grown to expect more from your company.  I will continue to buy your brand, but will pay more attention to what i'm buying.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2019
Reebok Kids' Yourflex Train 10 Sneaker,Not worth it,"I had to send the first pair back. A piece of the sole ripped off after only a few wears and my son only wore them to school. I did reorder them bc my son loved the look, and said they were comfortable. So just hoping it was a fluke.  Nope, they didn't hold up.  Don't waste your money.",Reviewed in the United States on 5 May 2019

Reebok Kids' Yourflex Train 10 Sneaker,Not what I was expecting,I can't speak to the quality since we sent these back.  The picture and description led me to believe the shoes were lace up shoes.

ALLY UNION MAKE FORCE Mens Womens Walking Shoes Lightweight Mesh Slip-on Running Sneakers Gray Size: 8 Women/7 Men,An honest review from a Shoe Addict.,"The sizing chart is wierd because it's Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9""x3"" and according to the listing's size chart, I should order a Men's 5/Woman's 6. However, I'm a US Woman's Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men's 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men's) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman's) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl's (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it's a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won't make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I'd recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead). That being said, I recommend these Sneakers as a low-cost option for travel because they are light weight, great for casual walking, easy to pack, and perfect for security check points.NOTE: I was NOT compensated in any way for my review. I paid full price for the pair I'm wearing in the photo. I think some of the other reviews may be fake so I wanted to add a comprehensive and honest review.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 May 2020

However there's also too much slippage in the toebox and my feet roll to the inside with each step. I wouldn't wear these if I needed to do much walking, but for average wear they're ok. They're fun and colorful and I hope they last long enough for me to get over them. Lol. I ordered  my actual size, but turns out a half-size smaller might've been better.

These don't hurt his feet and they are good solid comfortable shoes.  It's important to have good shoes that fit for your child...and they you want to be as cost effective as possible because they need a new pair every 6 months.

"Superfit Girls’ Rainbow Sandals, Blue (Blue 80), 2 UK","Ferse rutscht zur Seite heraus, Klettverschluss anfällig","Meiner Tochter haben die Sandalen sofort gut gefallen und auch direkt gepasst. Sie lassen sich gut zu vielen Kleidungsstücken kombinieren. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt.Leider sitzt die eine Ferse (womöglich durch die Riemenkonstruktion) oft schief im Schuh.Meine Tochter rockt Schuhe schnell herunter. Diesmal hat die Sohle bisher gut gehalten, dafür schloss der Klettverschluss nicht mehr richtig. Ich habe daher die Nähte am Klettband abgetrennt und den Klettstoff mit Klettband aus dem Hobbymarkt ersetzt. Es war selbstklebendes Band.

"Superfit Girls’ Rainbow Sandals, Blue (Blue 80), 2 UK",Déçue,"Je les ai achetées pour ma fille de 11 ans et demi, qui a le pied  fin , la marque possède des modèles à scratch qui permettent de règler la sandale .  (les marques que je prenais habituellement  s'arrêtaient au 34-35 quand j'ai acheté celles-ci, ou bien il n'y avait plus la pointure ou bien elles restaient trop chères). Première deception: les scratchs croisés de devant ne peuvent pas resserrer la sandale,  il n'y en a qu'un qui est scratché, celui en textile ne bouge pas et la sandale est faite pour un pied medium- large et pas fin,  par contre en longueur  elles sont  plutôt courtes. Les sandales n'ont pas crée un attrait irrésistible, c'est vrai qu'elles sont confortables et la semelle est épaisse et souple. Le problème de ces sandales c'est qu'elles sont un hybride râté entre la sandale classique et la sandale de marche .La partie en textile est malvenue et donne une impression ""tchip"", Le ""cuir"" ne couvre pas assez le pied pour le protéger et les couleurs sont peu séduisantes . Le prix de base est exagérément élevé, le prix Amazon (46 euros) reste cher.Ce ne sont ni des GBB (pour la qualité et l'esthétisme) ni des geox pour le confort ou le coté sportif.

I have purchased NB shoes in the past with no problem but I sent these back the same day I received them. I read the reviews re: tendency to run small. So I ordered a size larger (length) and instead of my usual 4E I ordered 6E.  Waaaay to tight. To the point it was ridiculous. Figured they gave me the wrong size. Nope. Right there on the label. When 1 person says they're to tight, that's one thing. When a dozen people say it, something is wrong. NB should be ashamed.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 May 2019

On top of that, I've developed Plantar Fascitis  after 50 years of working on my feet.  I tried multiple boots and found no comfort.

However, the design is not a good one for men with wide feet.  The tongue of the shoe is sewn to the sides (?), making it difficult to put the shoe on and uncomfortable across the top of the foot. It also is very narrow; I measured the sole of a size 11 6E against a pair of New Balance size 11D shoes and the difference in width was negligible.

I’m not really a runner, I bought these shoes mostly for style but i gotta say I never realized how much a shoe matters in running until I bought these. Definitely good for running.

adidas Women's Pureboost Go white Size: 4.5 UK,A great running shoe!,"I had a new pair of these and my college D1 athlete came home due to the quarantine - she’s a swimmer - suddenly turned runner, she swiped my shoes.  Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back.  Very hard to purchase shoes when you can’t try them on.  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like.  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid.  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time.  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly.  I am a size 10 and I have enough room in the toe for long runs.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2020

I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all. I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel. The shoes are not comfortable.

   Ayant facilement des douleurs aux genoux, j'étais à la recherche d'une chaussure confortable et polyvalente à un prix abordable. Sur recommandation d'un collègue expert en la matière, j'ai choisi ce modèle et je dois dire que les premiers essais sont très intéressants !On a l'impression de chausser des pantoufles, très confortables même si l'épaisseur de la semelle sous le bout du pied semble très fine, on oublie ce détail en courant.L'arrière, bien plus épais, propose un très bon amorti mais qui reste stable pour autant. Elle est dynamique avec un arrondi qui fait gagner en confort. L'énergie se disperse bien.J'étais avant sur une chaussure à la semelle plate (hors grip) et la forme présente sur ce type de modèle représente un vrai agrément.On sent un peu l'effet ressort à chaque foulée et ça donne envie d'aller plus vite et plus loin.La pointure correspond aux autres marques, ne taille ni trop petit ni trop grand.Je recommande cette paire et si cet avis vous aide à vous décider, n'hésitez pas à cliquer sur le bouton utile ci dessous.",Reviewed in France on 7 October 2021

Skechers Men's Evented-renson Sandal brown Size: 12 UK,Not Enough Velcro on the Front Strap...,"...if you have a high instep. Like many shoe companies now, Skechers skimps on Velcro, saving a fraction of a cent, but making the shoes unwearable unless you have low-profile feet. Yet at the same time, there's way more Velcro than would ever be needed on the heel strap.There are also prominent ridges across the sandals separating the toes from the rest of the foot, as well as another ridge between the large toe and the remaining toes. So, unless you have perfectly average feet, you may find those uncomfortable.The relaxed fit is a nice idea, just poorly executed in lacking sufficient Velcro.",Reviewed in the United States on 3 June 2021

"adidas Kids' VS Switch 2 Sneaker, Dark Blue/White/Hi-Res Red, 3K M US Infant",Awesome shoes. Sole removes easily which could be good or bad.,Second pair of these. They don’t scuff easy like some of the cheaper tennis shoes for toddlers. They are sturdy and fit well. Unfortunately the sole comes right out so if you have a kid that likes to take off their shoes you could find one sole mysteriously disappears during daycare one day. Under the sole is rock hard so you can’t continue wearing them unless you can find a similar replacement sole.,Reviewed in the United States on 19 June 2018

"New Balance Men's Cruz V2 Fresh Foam Sneaker, Black/Castlerock/Nubuck, 6.5 UK",Changing my review,"I wrote an earlier review giving these shoes 4 stars. I'm changing that to 2. I'm giving them a 2 because they are comfortable as walking shoes. The reason for the demotion is due to the mesh material they are subject to getting holes in them which is poor construction, so my earlier praise is gone. I was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe. Nothing you can do to fix it. So now water comes in and you can see your foot or sock if white. I missed the return date by one day. Too much money to get holes in them. You shouldn't go around being afraid of your shoe getting holes. New Balance should know better and so should I.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 May 2019

Received in a FLASH! Wooo - got here in one day, and I put 'em on (with a shoe horn) and wore 'em to a meeting last night. Plenty confy, and they look pretty good.  My bride was surprised I'd buy blue shoes, let alone WEAR them!?!?! Stylin' R Me.As to used - one shoe has a crimp where the big toe goes, and a spot with what could be a very light stain. Bottoms don't look like they've been worn much. The crimp worried me, but I didn't feel it at all, and they're really ""grippy"" on the floors. So far, so good.

I bought them and have been fairly pleased.They are super comfy and possess all the aspects of NB that I have grown accustomed to...but they fit a little strange. Im a dude with a small-ish foot (size nine) but that usually is a perfect fit with NB, but these arrived and they seem to run a little big, my foot slides around a bit more in these than other NB shoes for some reason.

As I ran, my feet from my arch forward felt too loose.  In fact, my toes crept forward over the outline of the sole of the shoe and were making contact with the ground with only the mesh as a barrier.  Tightening my laces did not help the issue.

"Clarks - Womens Wave2.0 Step. Shoes, 4.5 UK Wide, Stone Combi",Not friendly to custom orthotics,"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.TL;DR -- don't buy if you wear custom orthotics, don't buy if you pronate, don't believe they will stretch when you try them on.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 March 2021

"Lloyd Men's Alfonso Sneaker, Black, 9.5 UK","Schuh ist super, aber Vorsicht mit Prime Wardrobe Bestellungen","Zunächst vorneweg, der Schuh ist super, passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick. Verarbeitungsqualität lässt keine Wünsche offen. D.h. der Schuh selbst verdient keine 1-Stern Bewertung, aber man kann nur das Produkt bewerten und nicht das Kauferlebnis selbst. Das ist ja grundsätzlich bei Amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als Amazon-Junkie als Amazon-Kunde, aber was diesmal mit der Prime-Wardrobe Bestellung passiert ist, ist denke ich eine Rezension wert, denn das geht gar nicht, weiß nicht so recht wo der Fehler ist, das muss Amazon versuchen zu lösen. Folgendes ist passiert: Sehe den Schuh zum sensationellen Preis von 79 EUR (bei Zalando war er deutlich teurer) und lege ihn in den Warenkorb. Es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem Preis zu kaufen oder in Wardrobe zu dem Preise zur Anprobe. Denke mir nichts und lege ihn in Wardrobe, könnt ja sein, dass er nicht passt, also nutze ich doch den komfortablen „Zur-Probe Bestellweg“. Schwups bestellt und bekomme per Mail die Bestätigung, aber ohne Preis (0,00 EUR wurde abgebucht) steht da nur in der Bestätigung, denke mir nichts, denn habe ja für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt, also wird es schon passen. Drücke nochmal auf den Artikel und sehe Preis liegt jetzt bei 87 EUR, ok denke ich, da habe ich ja nochmals Glück gehabt und einen richtig guten Preis bekommen. Denkste! Heute Schuh bekommen, passt perfekt, also gleich ins Amazon-Konto und Schuh behalten drücken, aber was steht da. Schuh für 87 EUR kaufen oder zurückschicken. Hmm, aber ich habe doch für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt und bestellt. Aber nirgends ist ein Beweis dafür zu finden. Im Kundenkonto steht 87 EUR und in der Bestätigungsmail kein Preis. Habe das doch nicht geträumt, also Kundenservice angerufen, aber nichts zu machen. Ich kann gerne zurückschicken, die 87 EUR ist der Preis. Ok, das war kein besonders gutes Kauferlebnis, muss ich jetzt die Preise abfotografieren nach der Bestellung. Na egal habe den Schuh trotzdem bezahlt, er war auch mit 87 EUR sehr günstig, aber ähnlich Zalando (89 EUR) was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar EUR mehr oder weniger. Aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon, das man Artikel zu einem bestimmten Preis in den Warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den Preis bestätigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen Preis bestellt bzw. dann den Kauf abschließen muss. Das geht so nicht! Habe definitiv beim Abschicken der Bestellung (Knopf jetzt Bestellen) den Preis von 79 EUR angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch, dass ich zu dem Preis kaufe und kein anderer, auch wenn Preise „im Hintergrund“ schwanken. Aus meiner Sicht ein Fehler im System und für mich ein Grund Wardrobe nicht zu nutzen. Also Vorsicht beim Bestellen über Wardrobe! Keine Ahnung ob ich ein Einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese Erfahrung gemacht haben, definitiv muss Amazon aber hier am System nachbessern.",Reviewed in Germany on 27 October 2020

"LifeStride Women's NEON Loafer, Blush, 4 UK",Nothing fancy but they're Comfortable as all get out!!!,"Written this before but it always bears repeating: I. HATE. These kinds of reviews.They're loafer style sneakers. They're black loafer style sneakers. They're a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really don't think about much. They wear out and you get new ones so, what in the heck can you say other than that? Lol.Design-wise, they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel. An inch isn't noticeable in the slightest- you don't even conciously feel it but, when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel... OMFG does that little inch make all the difference!!!The designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy. Anyone who has *ever* gone without socks in warm weather (pretty common to do in this style of shoe) know why that's a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoes.I know that doesn't bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the *instant* your body even *thinks* about sweating drive me bonkers. Lol.Maybe it's the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason, I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe. Lol.Anyway, there wasn't any breaking in for me on these. Another nice touch. I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for years.On the other side of things, they also seem to be wearing quite well.So, yeah, they don't look like anything special and, I guess in a way, they're kind of not but, they're nicely put together enough that you *don't* really think about them. Well, at least, you don't unless you're sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which, for me at least, proves that they're actually a nice product that probably won't get nearly the reviews that they probably should. ;)",Reviewed in the United States on 17 May 2020
"LifeStride Women's NEON Loafer, Blush, 4 UK",Fix your sizing.,"Everyone is being nice and saying ""These run small, haha!"" but I just ordered a size 8 and it doesn't even fit my sister who usually wears a 6. Same story with the other pair of shoes I bought from this brand. This isn't just running small, this is inaccurate sizing. Shoes aren't like clothes, I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary. But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 (US). This is just inexcusable honestly.

"LifeStride Women's NEON Loafer, Blush, 4 UK",Very pleased,"Lifestride shoes caught my eye on sale in a physical shoe store but selection was very limited so I hoped to find them similarly priced online. My usual size (9.5) felt a rather snug, not necessarily uncomfortable short term but I could not guess we'll enough what it would cause during longer wear. They seem to advertise having some kind of special arch support.. I'm not blown away by that, having said that I don't feel my feet fatigue either soo.. I guess thats working?On here I chose to go to a size 10 ""narrow"" just in case 9.5 really was too snug. I'm happy I did. The nose seems a little long but is just perfect while walking around. I have weirdly narrow long feet that also tend to get ugly gaps with low cut shoes. I still have some gaping but it isn't triggering me as much as it normally would. The shoe cups and forms nicely around my feet (no slipping off my heel yay!) and the leather is very soft. They're absolutely worth a try.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 September 2021

We mounted these on a stud in the garage so they are very sturdy but still not meant for a lot of weight; even more so if you were to mount them on an inside sheet rock wall, even with wall anchors, these are only meant for supporting the weight of ball, not much more.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 August 2019

"Reebok Women's Sole Fury TS Cross Trainer, White/Pink/Black, 3 UK","Not for athletic use, but very comfy","I want to love these. They are very cushioned, like you are on foam springs and they look amazing, but that's it. I feel like I can slip out of them or roll an ankle. The shoe material is so stretchy, it feels like a child's craft foam fabric which is great if you want light weight but seller is wrong to classify this as a cross-trainer. It is for running IF that, maybe just a pretty house slipper. Also I have narrow feet but this is for people with like 2D feet. Squishes down  from top to sole not width. I usually fit size 9, these were 9.5.Was going to return them but I do love how they look and they are comfy, just not for any athletic.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 April 2020

And when I first put them on, I loved them.  But after walking around the house for an hour or so, they felt so tight!  The fabric really didn't stretch even as much as leather might.  I bought an 8 1/2, which is 1/2 size larger than I normally buy, so I didn't feel comfortable moving to a 9.  It wasn't the length that was the problem; they were just too inflexible.  Sadly, I sent them back.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2019

But hopefully, they will last for about 2-3 years. Because I love the design and texture of the sneakers so much.The color white get dirty easily, so not recommend to run on rainy day.And $50 for this cool pair of sneakers...

"Reebok Women's AZTREK Double Mix Trail Sneaker, Black/Emerald/Regprp, 5.5 UK",Love them,"I am a 7-7.5 in shoes, & in Reebok, have always worn 7.5. I saw the reviews warning that these ran small, but the Mineral Mist, in 7.5, was $22, so...had to try. At first I thought they were just too small, but a lot of that is their thickness & stiffness. I decided I was keeping them anyway (did I mention $22), & within an hour of wearing them, they felt fantastic, & I think an 8 would have been loose. They are gorgeous, & the colors are as vibrant as pictured. My only complaint was that the left shoe was just a teeny bit narrower across the top, as you can see in my photo, but it isn't noticeable unless you're looking for it. And I'm not giving up my $22 pair, so I'll get over it. I can't even deduct a star for it.Love the retro style, & great colors.

The seller was super diligent in connecting with me to make sure I understand how to measure. I just based it on the measurement when I put a tape measure to my foot.Since I'm wearing this as an ""everyday shoe"" I've put in some insoles which have made them a bit tighter but the leather will eventually adjust.

Linodes (Tent Leather Upper Jazz Shoe Slip-on for Women and Men's Dance Shoes brown Size: 7 Women/6.5 Men,Carefully pick the size!,"Pros: Made nicely, seem like comfortable, if it is your fit.Cons: Run large. My foot is 7 medium width, After reading the reviews I went from 7 (thats my Nikes, Sketchers-relaxed fit sneakers size), to 6.5 and they are still too big. Should have ordered at least 6. And still the fit is interesting. It is good that they have free return option with amazon prime, cause it is not so easy to find your fit. I am returning them and dont think I will order another size, cause they dont feel right for Zumba (slippery, no ankle support). But they might be good for other dancing lessons, like ballet for non-profs. If your foot is narrow, not high arch I would even recommend going from 7 to 6, cause in time they have a tendency to strech. (I can easily insert a finger, photo included).",Reviewed in the United States on 23 January 2018

Fit as expected and good quality.theyve stood up to the last three months of rehearsals and still look great. For reference my daughter is a size 5-6 depending on the shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2018
Linodes (Tent Leather Upper Jazz Shoe Slip-on for Women and Men's Dance Shoes brown Size: 7 Women/6.5 Men,Looks can be deceiving....,"The shoe looks like it is three times too small....until you put it on and realize that it stretches at the arch area to allow you to have a hell under your heel and a pad under the ball of your foot.  Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1"" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.  Happy dancing!!",Reviewed in the United States on 28 May 2019
Linodes (Tent Leather Upper Jazz Shoe Slip-on for Women and Men's Dance Shoes brown Size: 7 Women/6.5 Men,Too big,"The shoes seem fine, but going by sizing guide they are too large.  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don't know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don't want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.

Linodes (Tent Leather Upper Jazz Shoe Slip-on for Women and Men's Dance Shoes brown Size: 7 Women/6.5 Men,PERFECT!!!!,"Even in Chair Yoga we get out of the chair and do some standing poses.  I wear a size 8.5 shoe but I need orthodics  in them. So sometimes I have to go up a half size or even a full size.  I ordered these and they fit perfect with my orthotics in them!  They are super soft leather so it's like I am barefoot with the support I need.

Linodes (Tent Leather Upper Jazz Shoe Slip-on for Women and Men's Dance Shoes brown Size: 7 Women/6.5 Men,Held up really well,"My son dances a lot for musical theatre. I just looked up this order and am amazed at how long they lasted, well over a year, but  the sole is getting worn down now. They still look pretty good and support him but he is 15 and still growing so I think I probably ordered them on the large side but they are super comfy for him while dancing and if he forgets to take them to class he gets sore if he uses regular shoes.But I need to get the tan color instead of black so I re-measured his feet and will be ordering up by one size and definitely sticking with this brand.For the price I think these performed really well--all the seams are still perfect, nothing ripped or torn, just use shows wear on the soles and on the  leather part of the toe, partly from his feet growing.  For an adult or kid who dances more than him they will probably last for 6- 12 months. When new, they look just like the picture shows and don't need to be broken in.",Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2018

Linodes (Tent Leather Upper Jazz Shoe Slip-on for Women and Men's Dance Shoes brown Size: 7 Women/6.5 Men,Measuring instructions WAYYY off! HUGE! Also hideous...,"After reading many reviews, I decided to just do what the manufacturer suggested. I measured my daughter's foot, which heel to toe was exactly 9 3/4 inches. Based on the manufacturer's own guide, I ordered an 8.5 for her. In my gut I knew this had to be wrong, as she usually wears 7.5 or 8 max. But based on their own guidelines, I went for it. THEY. WERE. HUGE. HUGE. and HIDEOUS. I wear a 9 and they were HUGE on ME. She needed them asap, so I hop on and order a size 7.5, thinking an entire size down would be better. Wrong again. The 7.5 were better, but still and entire size too big for her. .At this point I gave up, took her to our local dance store and ponied up the $15 extra they cost there vs. these. They fit great and are much more attractive. I would not recommend these. Not worth my time, and now I have to send these monsters back lol.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 July 2019

Diadora Women's Capitano ID Indoor Soccer Shoes,Good shoe - pay attention to which sole is best,"While I did like the fit and the upper padding, I had to return because the flat sole had me slipping around in the turf indoor while I’m in goal.

"Reebok Women's Walk Ahead Action RS Walking Shoe, Black/White, 7 UK",Cute-yes. Small and pointy-yes.,"Although these are cute and very lightweight, as other posters have said they run small. In my case I ordered a size up, and they were still too small.  They also have a very narrow toebox, which affects the fit as well. The insole is definitely squishy, however there is next to zero arch support. This of course can be good for some people, as can the narrow toebox ( these would be great for one of my daughters, however they are not available in her size).  They do seem to be constructed well, and feel sturdy, although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks, but I have to return these so I won't be able to find out for sure about that.",Reviewed in the United States on 15 June 2015
"Reebok Women's Walk Ahead Action RS Walking Shoe, Black/White, 7 UK",Okay,"My biggest problem with these shoes was that they rubbed the back of my Achilles tendon area. Maybe that only happens with some people, I really don't know the reason. That was pretty much all it took for me to stop wearing them. They have a comfortable sole which is like memory foam or something. The shoe is a bit narrow so if your feet swell from activity they may be a bit too tight at the end of your day. I wore them hiking but they're really more of a straight out walking and maybe running shoe. I bought them in gray which was also a bit boring and made my foot look longer.",Reviewed in the United States on 22 May 2016
"Reebok Women's Walk Ahead Action RS Walking Shoe, Black/White, 7 UK",LOVE THESE! THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE RUN ABOUT 1/2 SIZE SMALL....,"I love these shoes!!  However, they do seem run a little small; which is why I gave them 4 stars.  I usually wear a 7.5, which is what I ordered.  But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe. The first day was the worst one. They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed, my big toenails (and yes, they were cut) hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day.  It's day three and I can tell they've stretched a little bit, but next time I'll try an 8 to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, they are extremely comfortable.  They're very soft and very light--I hate wearing heavy, clunky shoes.  They're the perfect shape, also.  Not too small and thin like a simple pair of old school Keds, but not too bulky that you feel like they'd only work with jeans or athletic wear. I had on a nice grey t-shirt and some knee-length, jean shorts and they didn't make my feel look like giant boats.  I would definitely order more in different colors.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 May 2015
"Reebok Women's Walk Ahead Action RS Walking Shoe, Black/White, 7 UK",Surprisingly comfortable.,"I usually where heavy walking shoes with lots of padding, plus custom orthopedic inserts, so I was concerned that I would not be able to wear these very long.  However the foot bed is very comfortable, and I find that I forget I am wearing them.  Although I checked the ""all day"" rather than ""couple of hours"" box, I probably would not wear them all day--but definitely more than just a couple of hours. My only complaint is that they only come in one width and for me are a little bit too narrow.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2015
"Reebok Women's Walk Ahead Action RS Walking Shoe, Black/White, 7 UK",Most comfortable shoes I've ever worn!,"I've begun walking at least 10,000 steps/day and was developing severe blisters on the balls of my feet, spreading to between my toes. I thought I had a good pair of shoes, but apparently not. As soon as I put these shoes on for my first walk on the treadmill after receiving them, it was as if the blisters were never there! These shoes are extremely lightweight and so comfortable!! I've been able to increase my walking and not have pain in my feet at all! I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone!!!!!",Reviewed in the United States on 2 February 2015

"New Balance - Mens MD1100V1 Walking Shoes, 9 UK - Width 4E, Brown/Maroon",A pair of convincing knock offs...,"At first glance, I thought something was off with these black suede 1100s but I was not quite sure what was amiss. So I got out my favorite blue suede 1100s for comparison (see pictures).1. The contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the 1100s2.and upon closer inspection, the insoles were also quite different.You can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede 1100s come with a more expensive removable insole. The difference in quality is clear. but only because I have an authentic pair from a reputable brick and mortar store to compare the convincing knockoff 1100s to are the differences made apparent.Don't get me wrong I don't mind low cost ""replicas"", but I paid almost 140 with taxes for these. This could just be a one-off, or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined. Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB product?In any event, I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer. Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying. That's how I ended up with the blue ones.  Any local retailer still in business has to be doing something right and will be happy to order whatever you want.",Reviewed in the United States on 20 September 2019
"New Balance - Mens MD1100V1 Walking Shoes, 9 UK - Width 4E, Brown/Maroon",I’d pass - Update after a couple of month in them,"I wish I hadn’t worn them or I’d send them back.  I ordered them as I kind of like the way they looked and I generally like NB. Narrower than a normal D. Uncomfortable on the TOP, as the laces dig in some. For me, OK to wear if I’m only going to be in them a little while and not walking much. Definitely not a walking shoe.So I've had these a couple of months now and thought I would share what I've found.The good - they are cool looking. i get comments every time I wear them and folks are surprised to see they are NB.They've gotten a bit more comfy as they have worn in some, but these are not shoes for being on your feet all day and they are definitely not a walking shoe. Good for casual wear.The bad - the sole (black rubber beneath the maroon sole) separated at the front on both shoes rather soon. I used some shoe glue (Amazon) and it did the trick, but one would think they could have joined them better at manufacturing.Would I buy them again? maybe. They do look good.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 April 2019

"ARA Women's COURTYARD Sneaker, Rubin, 3.5 UK","Weich, nicht zu warm, sehr gut","Der Winter kommt, das weiß ich sicher. Wie ich ihn dieses Jahr verbringen werde, ist eine Frage für sich.Doch, man braucht Schuhe, die man in der Zeit, in der sich Sonne nur zögernd zeigt, schon mal der ganze Tag regnerisch ist, der Schnee ist auch nicht weit.Wenn die Tage im Nebel versinken, tut es gut, wenn die Schuhe (es sind hörere Schue, keine Sneaker(s) im üblichen Sinne) in einer schönen Farbe signalisieren - da bin ich, man sieht mich. ROT ist die Farbe der Schuhe, und sie ist einfach wunderschön.Die Schuhe sind in ""H"" Größe/Weite, also weiter geschnitten, was mir/uns ermöglicht sie mit den Wollsocken zu tragen. Neben schwarzen Schnürsenklen, die fast dramatisch wirken, gibt es auf jeder Seite einen Reißverschluss, der sich sehr leich öffnen lässt.Man kommt in die Schuhe sehr leicht hinein. Die Füße danken es ihnen. Die Schuhe drücken nirgendwo, sie sind leicht und doch stabil.Meine übliche Größe passt hier.Es sind KEINE Goretex-Schuhe, man soll daran denken, wenn man im Regen/Schnee spazieren geht. Aber, sie vertragen schon etwas Nässe...Kälte, wie geschrieben, mit Socken.Sie sehen an den Beinen ansprechend aus. Perfekt kombinierbar, wirklich tragbar und wieder in SALE. Auch der reguläre Preis ist nichz zu hoch.So sehr ich Sneaker liebe, kann nur schwierig ""nein"" sagen, wenn ich wieder ein neues Modell sehe, so bin ich bei Herbst/Winterschuhen einer oder höchstens zwei Marken treu geblieben. Diese ist eine von beiden.Was mir gefällt, die Form ist modern, auch hier hat die Firma einige Schritte gemacht.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung!",Reviewed in Germany on 14 November 2020

BMS Raincoat 100% Waterproof - Red with White Dots - 40L - Long Arms,Die Qualität hat extrem nachgelassen.,"Ich habe zwei Jacken bestellt, in Farben Limette und Grün. Die Farbe Limette ist wie abgebildet. Dies ist Geschmackssache. Was ich aber zu bemängeln habe, ist der Schnitt und vor allem die schlechte Qualität des Stoffes. Ich habe die gleiche Jacke (in grün), die ich schon vor ca. 4 Jahren in einem Store gekauft habe. Die ist mir Superbegleitung beim Regenwetter gewesen, nur ist sie etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Daher habe ich mir überlegt, noch eine zu kaufen, war aber sehr enttäuscht. Die grüne Farbe ist etwas abgewandelt, aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch. Nur die alte Jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden Stoff. Die Jacken, die ich hier bestellt habe, sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an Körper. Ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der  Schnitt geändert. Die Größe 36 sitzt jetzt anders, enger, unbequemer (auch des Stoffes wegen) und im Brustbereich extrem eng. Außerdem fehlen an der Jacke unter den Achseln zwei Öffnungen zur Durchlüftung. Sehr schade. Die Jacken gehen sofort zurück.",Reviewed in Germany on 15 September 2020
BMS Raincoat 100% Waterproof - Red with White Dots - 40L - Long Arms,"Die Jacke ist schön, ABER...","Die angegebenen Maße stimmen leider überhaupt nicht. Habe statt 48/50 schon 56!!! bestellt. Und mehr geht leider nicht.Lt. eigener BMS-Größentabelle im Umfang 140 cm.Nachgemessen leider nur knapp130 cm. 10cm !!! weniger.Klingt gut, wenn man sagt, wie liefern bis 56.Aber genaugenommen ist es nur eine ganz knappe 48/50.Schade, das man da nicht genauer arbeitet oder zumindest die Angaben richtig macht.Und...OekoTexSiegel und dann kein Baumwollinnenfutter(wie fast alle Mitbewerber), sondern Nylon?Schade,war zwar die teuerste aber trotzdem mein Favorit,bei meiner Jackenauswahl.Anmerkung: 2 Flyer plus 2 A4 Hochglanz/4-Farbdruck Produktblätter plus 1 A4 Hochglanz-OekoCertifikate plus 1 A4 Umweltinfo-Blatt  plus ein 42-seitiger Katalog(in welchem die kompletten Infos der losen Blätter bereits sowieso enthalten sind) relativieren für mich ein eigentlich lobenswertes Engagement für Umweltschutz.Völlig Überflüssig !!!",Reviewed in Germany on 20 April 2021
BMS Raincoat 100% Waterproof - Red with White Dots - 40L - Long Arms,Leider nicht wasserdicht,"Zunächst das Positive. Das Material fasst sich sehr gut an, riecht nicht und hat keinerlei Knitterfalten nach dem Transport. Die Farbe ist ein sattes Melonenrot, wirklich schön. Habe 2 Nummern größer bestellt und die Größe passt perfekt. Sie ist hinten länger und sieht wirklich gut aus. Sie hat tiefe Taschen, in die allerhand reinpasst. Als  Regenjacke kann ich sie aber überhaupt nicht empfehlen. Ich war 10 Min. bei leichtem Regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den Unterarmen und vor allem an den Schultern. Jeder Windzug geht durch. Der Futterstoff innen ist glatt und kühl. Das ist unangenehm vor allem in den Taschen. Nach dem Tragen braucht die Jacke ewig zum Trocknen. Ich habe Regenjacken für 1/3 des Preises, die funktionieren. Dies war ein Fehlkauf und ist einfach nur eine übermäßig teure rote Jacke. Schade.",Reviewed in Germany on 15 March 2021
BMS Raincoat 100% Waterproof - Red with White Dots - 40L - Long Arms,"Größenangabe schwierig, Material und Aussehen top","Die Jacke ist echt hübsch.  Weil Leute schrieben, man soll sie größer bestellen, hab ich schon befürchtet, dass meine normale Größe zu klein sein würde und habe gleich 2 Jacken in Gr 52 und 54 bestellt.  Normalerweise trage ich eine 46/48. Ich hatte den Plan, einen dicken Wollpulli drunter zu ziehen.  Aber die 52 - also 2 Nummern größer  - ist einfach zu eng. Die 54 passt, aber mit Pulli wäre es zu eng. Habe beide zurück geschickt und jetzt eine 56 bestellt.An sich eine wunderschöne Jacke, die gut verarbeitet ist.  Das Material ist etwas steif. Die Farbe und Verarbeitung sind top. Aber die Größenangabe stimmt einfach nicht.Eine Nummer größer bedeutet dann aber auch, dass die Ärmel entsprechend länger sind.  Was sich auf dem Rad dann allerdings auszahlt.  Aber die Schultern sind halt auch breiter.  Aber mir gefällt die Jacke trotz dieser (grössentechnischen) Mängel sehr und ich freue mich auf die Lieferung der größeren Jacke.

BMS Raincoat 100% Waterproof - Red with White Dots - 40L - Long Arms,"Absolut empfehlenswert, jeden Cent wert","Kaufe nur noch BMS Gummistiefel, weil mich die Qualität einfach überzeugt. Die sind zwar nicht gerade günstig, aber jeden Cent wert, wie ich finde. Sie sind elastisch (bleiben auch an kühleren Tagen ""weich"", haben einen relativ kurzen und weiten Schaft, so dass Hosen locker reinpassen und auch kräftigere Beine gut Platz haben und sich die Kinder super darin bewegen können. Die Sohle ist schön flexibel und Schweißfüße gibt es auch nicht (von innen mit ganz dünnem Baumwollgewebe ausgekleidet). Absolut wasserdicht, tolle Farben, guter Sitz. Dadurch dass die Gummistiefel so flexibel sind (Sohle und auch Schaft) und nicht so hoch, können die Kinder super darin laufen und trampeln nicht durch die Gegend. Leicht an- und auszuziehen.",Reviewed in Germany on 8 July 2020

Die Stiefel 2x angehabt, 2x nasse Füße bekommen. Als Mutter eines kleinen Kindes bin ich sehr enttäuscht, schließlich kauft man Gummistiefel, damit die Kinderfüsse trocken bleiben und nicht umgekehrt.  Es reicht aus, wenn es draußen etwas frischer ist, bei nassen Füssen ist eine Erkältung vorprogrammiert. In der Corona-Zeit sehr ""erfreulich"".  Wenn man die Stiefeln betrachtet, findet man keinen Mangel. Der wird bei der Berührung der Stiefel mit dem Wasser gezeigt. Es war nicht einfach die Kontaktdaten des Verkäufers zu finden.

Die Kapuze ist etwas klein, vor allem, wenn man eine Mütze darunter trägt.Dafür habe ich mir aber schon seit längerem einen wasserdichten Südwester zugelegt. Der Mantel und Regenhut  sind eine unschlagbare Kombi.Den Mantel konnte ich auf mehreren mehrstündigen Regentouren auf seine Wasserdichte testen und bin vollstens zufrieden, da nicht ein Tropfen durch kam.Der Mantel wirkt sehr wertig und schön verarbeitet.

Was mich sehr stört ist das oben kein Stoff ist mit Kordel zum zu ziehen damit kein wasser/Dreck in die Schuhe kommt. Das passiert bei meiner Tochter immer wieder und nervt sie. Da man das aber ja auch auf dem Foto sieht ziehe ich dafür keinen Stern ab, eben gekauft wie gesehen (-; Die Stiefel riechen absolut gar nicht nach Chemie, das ist klasse. Allerdings ""fressen"" sich Erdspuren in die Farbe des Stiefels ein, ähnlich wie bei Kleidung, das finde ich bei Gummistifeln weniger schlimm da sie ja eh nicht zum schick sein gedacht sind (-:",Reviewed in Germany on 5 March 2018

Deutliche Abzüge gibts von mir wegen der Haltbarkeit. Nach 18 Monaten hat ein Schuh einen langen wasserdurchlässigen Riss ohne dass die Schuhe mit etwas anderem als Sandkastensand und Plastikspielzeug in Kontakt gekommen wären.

I'm going to preface my criticism with this: my son is hard on his shoes; he runs in his runner's club about a 1.5 miles a day and then plays hard the rest of the time,so,the laces didn't last two weeks, after about two months these are looking a bit worn and frayed on the upper near the toe, really its cosmetic.The sole is holding true its not pulling way or peeling like cheaper shoes do. the tread looks good  there is a lot of wear in the midfoot on the insert of the shoe so I am curious how long until the midfoot  cushioning starts to break down, so far so good they just look beat.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 February 2018

"Nike FS Lite 2 Running Shoes, Rot (Hypr Pnch/Hypr TRQ-Actn Rd-WHI), 3 UK",Eine einzige Enttäuschung!,"Nachdem ich inzwischen bereits diverse Turnschuhe der Marke Nike bestellt und anprobiert habe, muss ich sagen, dass es mich nicht wundert, dass die hier vorliegenden ""Nike FS Lite Run 2 Damen Laufschuhe"" auch nicht passen, denn anscheinend hat sich die generelle Unsitte der zu kleinen Turnschuhe eingebürgert, was sehr ärgerlich ist, ich meine, wenn man als Frau schon Größe 43 (!) bestellen muss, obwohl man normalerweise 2 Schuhgrößen kleiner trägt, und die dann auch nicht passen, ich hätte wahrscheinlich 44 oder 45 gebraucht!, das ist schon mehr als grenzwertig, normal ist für meine Begriffe anders. Ich frage mich, warum die Turnschuhhersteller an ihren Kunden vorbei produzieren, das kann es doch nicht sein! Aber bei den anderen großen Sportschuhanbietern ist es das gleiche Trauerspiel. Dabei sind gerade in dieser und der letzten Saison die Modelle so farbenfroh wie nie und man würde gerne sogar mehrere Paare kaufen, aber sie müssten natürlich passen, das tun sie aber nicht. Entweder drücken sie vorne von oben auf den großen Zeh herunter, was schmerzt, oder sie sind zu kurz und drücken, schmerzen ebenfalls, oder sie sind insgesamt am Spann viel zu niedrig, so dass man bei geschnürtem Schuh immer noch eine super breite Schnürlasche hat, von weitem sieht das dann aus, als hätte man Elefantenfüße, weil die Schuhe zu wenig Material haben um ganz geschlossen zu werden und das bei mir, die ich superschlanke Füße habe und jahrelang Ballett getanzt habe, einfach skandalös! M.E. sollten die Nike Leute ihren Produzenten mal neue Schuhformen spendieren, die hier scheinen noch aus einem anderen Kulturkreis zu stammen in dem man Puppenfüßchen hat, aber nicht die Füße einer großen, westeuropäischen Frau!",Reviewed in Germany on 18 February 2015

BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and you’re not able to get a proper tight fit. Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it. One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness, which lends to a loose fit.  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand. Last major issue which is the shoe doesn’t have enough arch support, atleast IMHO. On the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest I’ve seen, but at this point, I’ll probably stick with Puma or FootJoy.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2021
"adidas mens Golf Shoe, Grey/Green/Black, 10.5 Wide US",Solid Golf Shoes,"Needed to replace my spikeless Nikes that had no grip left (Nike Roche G, so not much spikiness on the bottom to begin with).Played my first 18 with these today. They did the job pretty well. They were a little stiff at first, but broke in and softened up in no time at all. I love the new BOA style tying mechanism. It's fun to just pull the knob up and flop your shoes off. They have great grip on the bottom, I felt very stable in my swings.I'd like them to have maybe just a little bit more cushioning. Nikes had a lot of suishy bounce in them. Don't get me wrong, they're definitely comfy. Nice and roomy.

After 12 holes my feet felt as if I was playing in leather soled dress shoes.  My heels are very low in the shoe and the ball of the feet feel bruised.  The support and comfort is completely different from my first two pairs of Adidas.  I will need to add inserts to play in these again.

However, the white stitching around the toe area wasn't quite as clean and neatly done as I would expect from Ariat.  I know these are only $150, but still, this kind of issue should be easily preventable.  Other than that, these boots are very comfortable, and took very little time to break-in.

It is hard to buy shoes online without trying them on first, so I gave it a go.  I took them out for a game last night.  They are very comfortable for turf, however, given the large size, my touch was heavy and I couldn't connect with long passes (getting under the ball).  My lesson learned, try the size before you buy.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 August 2019

Lethato Men’s Modern Classic Calfskin Leather Chukka Boots red Size: 14,Dressy Silhouette but a Sole for Business,I was a little cautious at first. $99 for calfskin leather uppers. Made in Italy so I decided to order a pair. I’m glad I did. Very comfortable with generous arch support. The sole is a proprietary dainite-like sole. The famous rubber studs. It was very grippy and it seems hard wearing which I like.  Now for the leather. It’s not a smooth leather. At first glance I thought it was a waxy suede or a rough out leather. It has a matte like finish. I do like it. It pairs very well with a suit or casual wear. Don’t wear any white socks. There’s some dye issues with the first few wears.,Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2018

"lumberjack Men's Navigator Oxford Flat, Beige, 7 UK","Bella scarpa, ma ci sono degli accorgimenti.","Comincio nel descrivere la scarpa, che è di buonissima fattura e il cui unico tallone d'achille è forse la suola, meno confortevole del modello Timberland, che ha un minimo di ""rimbalzo"", ma diciamo che non da fastidio a meno che non ci facciate i km in una sera.Per quanto concerne gli accorgimenti da seguire:- Se non avete già provato la scarpa, scegliete un numero in meno del vostro, calzano larghe, non tanto dalla  punta ma dal tallone, escono proprio. Io porto il 42 e il 41 mi sta bene.- E' una scarpa che va portata dal calzolaio, appena indossata vi accorgerete che non è un cuoio che cede facilmente al vostro piede, e a meno che non vogliate delle vesciche sui mignoli e sui talloni (come successo a me), portatele da un calzolaio e fatele mettere ""in forma"", un paio di giorni.Al ritorno, vi accorgerete di quanto la scarpa calzi meglio, e non soffrirete per nulla.La sto usando spesso, e l'ho acquistata da circa una 20ina di giorni.Acquisto consigliato, ma seguite questi accorgimenti.",Reviewed in Italy on 6 August 2021

"Teva Boys' T Manatee Sport Sandal, Dark Olive, 4 M US Toddler",They seem to run a little big and are very stiff.,"I like them, and they provide good grip and protection while being airy for my sweaty baby. LOL But there are two problems. They are verrrrry stiff. I cant bend them, without feeling like they might start spiting. I guess that makes them a little tougher? Also, we now have about 5 pairs of the same size shoes for our 17 month old daughter. They all seem to be pretty close aside from these. They are a little big. The issue with is, for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks. The shoes being to big, and being worn without socks will cause the lacing system/tongue to bunch up and hurt.  I would say if you could, order two on amazon wardrobe. One size down and one the regular size your little one wears.Ive never been a good student, so please excuse my poor writing. *thumbs up*",Reviewed in the United States on 11 May 2019

Blowfish Play Black Hawaiian Nights 8.5 M,Super cute!!,Loving these shoes! Some have mentioned them being hard to get on but I had no problem. No shoe horn needed. I bought the black Hawaiian print. Ordered my usual size and fit perfectly. Nice cushion inside but of wearing for a lot of walking you definitely want to wear some kind of ankle socks as they rub a bit on the pinkie toe after awhile.  I wore them at a festival for about six hours. No blisters...no pain...just a little rubbing on top of pinkie toe after a few hours.

"New Balance Men's Cruz V2 Sockfit Fresh Foam Running Shoes Sneaker, Raw Clay Stoneware, 7 UK",TAKE-NOTE: THERE ARE 2 VERSIONS,"I've now purchased 3 pairs of these. They are the most comfortable walking shoes I have found, by far (and I walk about 15-20 miles per day on a treadmill desk). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU SHOULD KNOW - there are two versions being sold here. One version is ""Made in the USA"", and the other version is made elsewhere. You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says ""Made in the USA"" on both the tung and side of the shoe. The non-USA version is more comfortable, but less durable. Also the USA version runs about 1 size small. I enjoy wearing both about equally. The US version is better for running, the international version is more suited for walking.

"New Balance Men's Cruz V2 Sockfit Fresh Foam Running Shoes Sneaker, Raw Clay Stoneware, 7 UK","Look awesome, not that comfortable.","I absolutely love the look of this shoe and the fact socks don’t need to be worn with them. I returned the normal size I always get since they felt way too big. Went down half a size and they were fairly tight. I stuck with the smaller size since I don’t want to wear socks with them and the hope they’d break in just a little (they have just a bit). This shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which I assumed before buying. They aren’t as “breathable I thought they would be as well. The biggest issue I’ve had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move. I’d have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles (I had to glue them down). I really love the look, but if you’re actually moving in them they don’t perform. I prefer Nike flyknit free run shoes if you want sockless shoes you can actually walk in.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 June 2019
"New Balance Men's Cruz V2 Sockfit Fresh Foam Running Shoes Sneaker, Raw Clay Stoneware, 7 UK",Odd fit,"These things looked really comfortable. I got about what I expected, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.the uppers are all an elastic material Nothing hard even above the heel. You slip them on like a slipper. the laces do nothing and are just for show. Elastic pulls your feet tight against the sole. So it is essentially like a slipper with a shoe sole. Unfortunately, that make them kind of hot. It is a little hard to get the shoe on without getting a wrinkle in your sock and that will make your feet hurt after a little while. The thing I like least about the shoe is that it feels and sounds like you are walking in galoshes. they flap a little when you walk.They are not terrible and they look good.

The woven ""sock like"" nature is comfortable for short periods but after a few months of wearing them every day, I've found that the lack of support they give your feet actually leaves them feeling more sore than a normal shoe, and my knees have started hurting. I think these would be great for times when you're not in them for very long, but I wouldn't recommend them if you're looking for a shoe to wear for 10hours a day",Reviewed in the United States on 1 March 2020

I just can't say enough good things about them. So I'm stocked up for the future I bought another five pairs. reason about so many sometimes on Amazon or other places you buy shoe and you love it and then five months or six months later down the road you want to buy that same pair and you can't find it. So what I've been doing the past year so is just buying multiple pairs so I don't run out. They're extremely sharp looking with jeans and shorts. They look sharp for casual and work.I am so pleased with these shoes these got to buy far be the best new balance in the most comfortable and extremely good-looking shoe.

Cool shoes but you may want to go 1 1/2 down if you have a more narrow foot. Update: Returning them. They are big and provide no protection for the toesies.

   Ho acquistato queste scarpe per il mio bimbo. La qualità è Geox: scarpe robuste, leggere, traspiranti e prodotte con materiali di qualità. Il piede non suda e le chiusure con il velcro tengono e sono solide. La suola è flessibile e ti rendi conto immediatamente che è comoda e di pelle! Anche dopo aver indossato le scarpe per qualche ora, non ho notato segni rossi sui piedini.Il design è prettamente sportivo,carino e si presta ad un uso quotidiano. Il colore è strepitoso, blu e rosso...a mio avviso sono più belle viste dal vivo!!!E poi vogliamo parlare delle luci LED? Il mio bimbo quando le ha viste è impazzito di gioia e ora vuole mettere solo queste scarpe! Comodissimo il tasto on/off per le occasioni più ""sobrie"".Sono molto carine indossate con jeans e felpa, ma anche con dei più pratici joggers. Peraltro le ho prese in promozione e quindi le ho pagate poco rispetto ai prezzi esposti nei negozi monomarca.La taglia corrisponde a quella delle scarpe abituali del bimbo.Consigliatissime per tutte quelle occasioni in cui occorre praticità.Ottimo anche il rapporto qualità prezzo.5 stelle meritate e riacquisto futuro delle Geox garantito!Dai un'occhiata alle foto e al breve video che allego così da farti meglio un'idea sul prodotto.Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto nella tua scelta e se così fosse, fammelo sapere 👇!",Reviewed in Italy on 11 February 2021

"Skechers Kids Girls' Slip on Water Shoe, Champagne, 5 Big Kid M",Very scratchy inside!,"These are terrible. I can’t believe they’re actually Skechers. I have worn many Skechers shoes of different types over the years, and have bought many different kinds for my girls. These are the first pair I’ve ever felt that have super uncomfortable interiors. They’re water shoes, so they’re meant to be worn without socks, yet the inside seam where the fabric backing is stitched to the main part of the shoe is so scratchy! My girls each tried on a pair and both were exactly the same inside, so I am returning both. We’ll be going with Speedo brand water shoes this year.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 April 2021
"Skechers Kids Girls' Slip on Water Shoe, Champagne, 5 Big Kid M",So close...,"These shoes were really cute on, and the neoprene back made them easier to get on and off than the classic style. I thought it would make it comfortable as well, however the neoprene is sewn into the shoe with a rather large sharp seam at the ankle. I ordered these for 2 children and both complained of the sharpness and had red marks within 2 minute of walking around the house. Sad because they were great in theory.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 March 2019
"Skechers Kids Girls' Slip on Water Shoe, Champagne, 5 Big Kid M",Little Kid sizes are actually Toddler,"The shoes are nice, but they don't have the proper size chart loaded on this Amazon page.  These ""little kids"" shoes say age 4-8. My soon to be 4 years old son wears a size 9 toddler shoe, so I thought since the size 6 was on sale, I would get it for him to grow into later.  Turns out its the same as a toddler size 6 shoe. Why don't they say age 0-4 toddler then?  And the big kid size must really be for little kids 4-8?Shoes are great, just need a better description and size chart.  Hope this helps any other mom wondering the same :)",Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2020
"Skechers Kids Girls' Slip on Water Shoe, Champagne, 5 Big Kid M","No stretch on heel, unfortunately a no go",I so wanted to love these. First off they are so pretty. The gold and pale pink combo looked great in person. I wanted a shoe my little one could slip on without assistance from me or having to sit down to put them on. Unfortunately these were not it. The neoprene back has almost no give so to put  on required sitting down and even then she struggled to get these on herself. I told her she could also wear them as a slip on and step on the neoprene backing but she complained that it felt uncomfortable under her foot. That was a feature I thought she would love to get out the door even quicker but again this was not the case. If the backing had more stretch it could be the perfect slip on water friendly shoe.  We'll be sticking to Natives and Crocs for our go to summer shoes. I was so bummed these didn't work out for us.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 May 2021

Wore those for a day and noticed a defect in the left insole, like a void in the padding between the two soles.  Sent in a request to Amazon for a replacement.  Returned those and received the replacement a few days later.  This pair has a weird anomaly with the insole of the right moc.  Kicking myself now for returning the first pair before the replacement arrived.  Between the two pairs I could have had one decent pair.  Giving up at this point, will wear them until they fall apart and just pretend that I'm not bothered by the feel of the right one.  Guess my expectations are just too high for a pair of $100 mocs.

I wear New Balance walking shoes in 8 1/2, 4E (the only company I know of that makes a shoe in that width). Amazingly, right out of the box these mocs were perfectly wide and had a very comfortable toe box.  I went through no stretching period at all. I must say I hesitated to pay, what, $80? Whatever. Now I wouldn't send them back for twice what I paid. I have only worn them inside. If I don't go out in them on concrete and asphalt, I figure I'll still be wearing them for at least ten years, maybe twenty. (I've even worn them to bed to keep my feet a tad warmer.)",Reviewed in the United States on 29 June 2019
"Minnetonka Men Double Deerskin Softsole 816 Mocassins, Beige (Natural), 5 UK",These Are Exactly What I Wanted,"I have been telling myself, for a good long time now, that $15 slippers from the superstore were good enough.I have been lying to myself, for too long now, and that lying was going to stop. Pronto.A good long time ago, I sold these moccasins. Simple, smooth, double deerskin soles.It wasn't the simplicity of a cheap slipper that I have wanted. No. What I wanted was the simplicity of these quality Minnetonkas.The lies are over, and a little piece of me that was askew was renewed. What I wanted is what I got, and what I got is worth every penny.I wear a size 11.5 shoe. I bought a size 11 moccasin. You will have no real idea of how your moccasins are going to fit during the first 24 hours of wearing them. If you follow the simple rule of choosing a moccasin one-half size below your normal shoe size, you will be able to see how the leather and stitching are conforming to you foot during that first day's use.If the moccasins are too tight, or too loose, then I have to ask you to reflect on the honesty with which you are reporting your shoe size. Please understand that there is nothing wrong with having size 13EEE feet. Please also understand, it is not Minnetonkas fault if you are trying to put that size 13EEE into a size 11 moccasin, and it doesn't fit or even falls apart. It just isn't.These moccasins have made me free.The leather is supple; the stitching is tight and a good complementary",Reviewed in the United States on 15 May 2020
"Minnetonka Men Double Deerskin Softsole 816 Mocassins, Beige (Natural), 5 UK",Comfortable moccasin; but too long. Not as advertised. Customer Service is outstanding.,"First size I ordered (as per reviews) was what I wear now. When the mocassins came in there was a nick in the leather. The mocassins were way too long. Do I returned for a replacement with the next smaller size. This set came in with one of rhe mocassins defective. Stitching was coming apart. And the mocassin was still too loose. They do feel comfortable to the naked foot. No arch support however. If you need arch support these are not for you, or (like I will, because I still like these) an arch support insert can be added. Hopefully this next time around they will fit.I am very grateful that they take CS seriously and are replacing these without charging me.

Well-made, comfortable and I am guessing they will be very durable, though it's too soon to tell for sure.  With a pair of cozy wool socks they are they perfect footwear for around-the-house fall and winter indoor wear.  The leather soles are thick enough for a quick trip out the mailbox or trash can so long as it is not wet outside. Note that they do run quite large. I ordinarily wear somewhere between a 9.5 and a 10.5 depending on the shoe (with the majority of shoes in my closet being a size 10) and I have a normal-width foot.

ASICS - Mens Hyper Throw 3 Sneaker,Effective Shoe,"We received the incorrect size and sent them back to exchange for the correct size. I have sent several items back to Amazon and it has always been a smooth process. As for the shoes, I bought a pare for my 9 year old son who throws shot put and discuss. He has a very flat wide foot and they fit him perfectly without having to get a wide size. You want them to have a snug fit. Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips. His PR’s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively. So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence. They are also affordable for a younger thrower that will eventually grow and need another pair at some point. ASICS quality is also on point.

I can really feel the difference in my connection with the ground. The first week I wore these, I PRd both my deadlift and my squat. Maybe just my mindset on those days but I do believe the shoes helped. They’re not only perfect for digging into the floor on heavy lifts, but they’re also super cute with shorts, jeans, leggings etc. I love em. I just absolutely love them. Wish I could find my size in some of the other colors because I would definitely add more of these to my “shoe collection.”  Some reviewers stated they’re like “clown shoes” because of the wide toebox- I do not find that to be the case but I do prefer a roomier toebox. Love the low profile (I loath thick soled sneakers). The first few wears I did notice a tightness across the top of the foot where the seam is but my the third time I wore them, they were broken in and are now my “close toed” shoe of choice. I found the fit to be very true to size. Love the color. And LOVE that the laces stay tied throughout my entire workout!",Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2019

These will help dig those heels on the ground during squats and deadlifts.  I am a powerlifter and have been looking for these shoes for so long.  Glad I found them now.

The shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them. I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refund/exchange. I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service. When I didn't hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again. Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored. I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer. I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26. I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days (the time it takes to inspect the item) and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days. This still has yet to happen. When I contacted customer service again, they now changed their story and said that because I didn't purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received.

"adidas EQ Running Shoe, Screaming Pink/Screaming Orange/White, 5 US Unisex Big Kid",Should have listened to other viewers the short strap is definitely an issue,I was so excited for these shoes for my son that I disregarded all of the negative reviews. But now I am stuck with the shoe that my son cannot wear because he literally tripped and fell out of the shoes because the strap is too short. I even sewed an extension on the strap to help make it longer and the velcro that is attached to the shoe is very weak.

"Skechers Women's Go Step Lite-Innovate Sneaker, Black/White, 5.5 Wide",like wearing socks with a sole,"love that Skechers offer so many stylish sneakers and shoes in wide width.  these are so comfortable, like wearing ankle socks with a sole.  the toe box is super roomy, and I think it would be roomy even in regular/medium width.  the fabric of the shoe allows for even more toe movement, good for me because I don't like constricting footwear.  for knockabout, running-errands footwear, you won't find anything much more comfortable than this, hence the 5-star rating.  for serious walking or standing, though, these will be lacking in arch support.  and I'd make sure to stay on flat, even terrain because the fabric doesn't provide much structure.

I have a hard time with shoes due to having a wide foot and needing something comfortable but stylish for a 30 something mom. I was previously buying ""cute"" Crocs brand, but they only have so many styles that aren't sandals. Plus they aren't cheap on Amazon and there's no store near me (retailers but not a full Crocs store). So if I order online and don't like them, I was stuck unless I wanted to pay return shipping.

Chaco Men&#39;s Z1 Classic Athletic Sandal,Excellent Sandal,"I have used Teva's since the 90's, but when my last pair died I decided to get something that looked a bit less ""dad sandal"" despite now being a father.  I'd heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I'm normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I've noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren't using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It's also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn't work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I'm happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.  If I were in the US, I'd happily pay the amounts being asked.",Reviewed in Canada on 4 September 2020

Chaco Men&#39;s Z1 Classic Athletic Sandal,Straps so long,We are big fans of chacos.  This pair seems fine but in previous pairs the strap around ankle did not hang down so long - once the shoe is secured at ankle there are at least 3 inches of extra that almost drag the ground....not sure why this change in design.  There are videos online of how to tuck up the strap but it seems like a design flaw compared to last models.,Reviewed in the United States on 15 June 2021
Chaco Men&#39;s Z1 Classic Athletic Sandal,Defective,"I received my 1st pair with the straps much to small to fit my feet, but I could not adjust the straps at all, like the straps were glued into position.  I returned the 1st pair, asking for a replacement.  The replacement had the same problem, the straps could not be adjusted.  When I returned the 2nd pair I was charged an $18.42 restocking fee despite that they were listed as ""FREE Returns"".",Reviewed in the United States on 18 November 2021
Chaco Men&#39;s Z1 Classic Athletic Sandal,Really good sandals,"Really good sandals. I loved that I could just slide them on and start wearing them without having to break them in. There was maybe a slight hassle to adjust the straps after purchase to fit my feet, but otherwise nothing too complicated. I’ve gone hiking and biking in them and haven’t been disappointed with the soles or straps. The only thing I have to say against them is that constant wear is abrasive to the skin, especially the toe straps. I haven’t gotten any blisters (I’m not really prone to them) but they do leave marks that only go away after a couple of days of not wearing them. Otherwise, I love them! Awesome traction, even when wet!",Reviewed in the United States on 26 July 2021

Chaco Men&#39;s Z1 Classic Athletic Sandal,Fit is spot on and they're surprisingly light,"I was a little concerned that these would run a little small (I usually buy size 10 but opted for 9 this time) because I've always had the impression Chacos run a little small.

It's just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear. Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy, as though she's been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months!

As boys do though, he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes.  The fabric that covers the top of the toes (looks like of like mesh) got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after ~3-4 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze it's pulled back so far.  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.

"ECCO Women's Biom Life Low-Top Sneakers, (White/White 50874), 7 UK",Great lightweight slip-on,"I purchased this pair because I wanted another sneaker from Ecco, but I wanted something that was a slip-on with a less traditional style than the lace-up sneaker of which I have 5 pair from Ecco in various colors, and this fit the bill.  As with all Eccos, I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever (I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe).  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have, but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted.  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you.  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months.  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them. They’re different than the average sneaker. They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits, obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect.  Also, great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when you’re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride, and really light to pack.

CLARKS Men&#39;s Un Globe Lace,Clarks quality comfort delivers again,If you're at all familiar with the Clarks reputation for comfortable shoes then there is really no need to read any reviews as Clarks are always a good decision and this pair of shoes is no different. I can wear these shoes for hours without my foot feeling any pain and they're breathable enough to prevent the shoe from getting too hot inside and creating an atmosphere in which odors can fester. The shoes look just as they do in the pictures so there's no surprises there either.,Reviewed in the United States on 19 August 2019

Sixspace Walking Shoes Women - Sock Sneakers Slip on Shoes for Women black Size: 6 UK,Die dicke Sohle ist sehr gelenkfreundlich in meinem Fall.,"Ich habe mir gedacht, dass diese Schuhe eine gute Dämpfung haben müssten und habe mich deshalb für sie entschieden. Ein anderes Modellsprach mich zwar mehr an, war in meiner Größe aber nicht mehr zu bekommen. Sie sind ganz fix gekommen, ohne viel unnötige Verpackung und haben nicht auffällig gerochen. Normale Passform und mit Sneaker oder Socken super zu tragen, reinzwängeln muss ich mich auch nicht.Schuhlöffel reicht, vorne über dem Spann richten/hochziehen und los geht's. Habe sie einen Vormittag im Haus getragen und mittags dann wegen warmer Füße ausgezogen. Ich empfand sie als angenehm, nicht zu locker und die Dämpfung war so, wie ich sie mir vorgestellt habe.Ich habe Probleme mit den Gelenken und deshalb diese dicken Sohlen. Wären sie als ""Schietwetterschuhe"" zu bekommen, für Hundespaziergänge, würde ich mich freuen.

Da ich ziemliche Wassereinlagerungen in den Beinen/Füßen  habe und nur der ""Eingang"" elastisch ist, kam ich jedoch nicht mal ansatzweise in den Schuh hinein, weswegen er zurück gehen wird.Schade, rutschfest und bequem wirkte er dennoch.",Reviewed in Germany on 17 July 2021

adidas Women&#39;s Icon Bounce,Great cleats at a great price,"I recently joined an adult kickball league at the request of a friend (don't laugh - this is real thing.  To be clear, I initially was only in it for the booze after the games).  We play on a softball field, and while running bases (OK, ONE base, it wasn't plural) I noticed my running shoes didn't have a really good grip on the ground.  A lot of folks on my team have been in the league for several years and have cleats, so I decided to plunge in and get some cleats.I liked these ones initially because of they were neutral colors and they didn't have plastic-like cleats.They fit just as expected.  They offer a lot of support (and my arches are virtually nonexistant).  I wish they had a little more ankle support.",Reviewed in the United States on 5 July 2019

"Timberland 6-Inch Leather and Fabric Field Boot (Toddler/Little Kid/Big Kid),Black Nubuck,1.5 M US Little Kid",Good Boots but not as durable as I hoped,"I am a very short 19 year old who works a construction type job - I'm on my feet all day, lifting things like concrete, shingles, and lumber. I bought these boots because tennis shoes were leaving my feet too vulnerable.I was pleased with the boots for the most part. They provided protection and kept sawdust, gravel, and concrete out. The treads had better grip than tennis shoes, so I slipped less. I wore them all winter, where I had to go out in the cold several times a day, and these kept my feet decently warm. Wouldn't recommend them as winter boots, though. They aren't water proof, so if I was in the snow for too long, my feet got wet. Still better protection from the elements than tennis shoes.I'm a little disappointed with the durability, though. It was only about 4 months until I started getting holes in the leather near the sole. I continued to wear them for another 4 months. They're not completely unwearable, but there are several holes in both boots. I only got to wear them for 8 months before having to replace them - for almost $70, I was hoping for more. I will look for something more durable for my next pair.I would recommend these as hiking boots, but be sure to treat them with water repellant first.

I'm so disgusted that THESE BOOTS R SO FAKE! It's TOTALLY obvious to the naked eye, u just can't tell from their pic. Real Timbs r much heavier, have 4 rows of stitching (instead of 2, nice try) & r of better quality (leather/suede/nubuck) & also weatherproof. I'm not sure what fabric these r made of but it's cheap and the ones I received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because I ordered 3 pair from 3 different groups: toddler, little kids & big kids. Maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i could've been fooled but then again they're so cheaply made I strongly doubt it! I foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just 2-3 wears; I just thought maybe that individual pair was defective. I should've known better since Ive ALWAYS paid way more for ALL of my other Timbs. I just saw the price & thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since Timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year. I spent slightly less than $160 on 3 pair of these so I initially saved about $80-$100 total but what's the point when I'm gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart?! I'm disappointed because I anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived. If u have never owned Timberland boots before then I suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel & see what type of boot U should b receiving when ordering online. If u have Timbs then it won't take u but a second to spot these knockoffs. I received the 3 pair that I purchased for my loved ones today and 3 pair r going rite back TODAY!!!!!!! I wasted my time but I WILL NOT waste my money. Dont b like me by ignoring the reviews and buying these anyway.

"New Balance Women's Vongo V4 Fresh Foam Running Shoe, Light Aluminum/Lime Glo/Glacier, 3 UK",Love these with a passion,"I'm an advanced runner, former collegiate track/cross country runner, averaging between 50-60 miles/week, and race 5k up to ultramarathons. I say this just to try to enforce that I like to think I know my running shoes. And I know this review is just my opinion, and that there is a perfect running shoe out there for everyone - this might not be yours, but holy cow, they are mine! I've been wearing Brooks Ghost and Launch for years, then started wearing Hoka Cliftons for long runs and recovery runs when I'm doing more ultra-focused training. I tend to find a shoe that works, then wear it religiously until they change it so much that I need to try something new, or if I get injured and that shoe feels like it has bad juju (slightly superstitious). I was overdue for new shoes, and went to buy the Cliftons but something prompted me to do some research and open my horizons. So I started looking around and came across the New Balance Vongo. I've been wearing neutral shoes for years, so was really hesitant to buy a stability shoe, but read that these are kind of on the neutral-end of stability, if there's such a thing.Anyway, with the <$100 price, I gave it a go because why not. It's now been about 2 months that I've been wearing them for just about every single run, and oh my gosh, I feel like I've hit the mother load. I recently ordered a second pair to have on standby for when my current pair is worn down, and am tempted to stock up on like 100 more pairs just so I know I'll have them for the rest of my life. The sock/knit liner is snug and keeps my foot in place, so I have no rubbing or hot spots. They are SO comfortable, they're like an extension of my foot. The foam is responsive and light so they work just as well for tempo's or interval workouts as they do for long runs. The grip is great and I actually prefer using these for trail runs over my specialty Salomon trail shoes. The only downside of these shoes (literally the ONLY downside) is that rocks seem to get stuck in the tread more often than any of my other running shoes.TLDR: These shoes rock.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2020

"New Balance Women's Vongo V4 Fresh Foam Running Shoe, Light Aluminum/Lime Glo/Glacier, 3 UK",Very comfortable.,"I have never owned New Balance running/walking shoes but these are very comfortable.  I walk approximately 12 miles a week, mostly on pavement and do several 5K's during the year.  They are very light in weight and I really like the tongue.  It is almost like a sock and it doesn't slip down in  your shoe.  Overall,  great price and good fitting shoe.  However, I did buy a size up because I think they run small.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 February 2020
"New Balance Women's Vongo V4 Fresh Foam Running Shoe, Light Aluminum/Lime Glo/Glacier, 3 UK",Caused severe calf cramps,"I don’t know why, but these shoes caused my calves to cramp up BAD. I run 3 miles a day, 5 days a week and when I switched to these shoes, my calves cramped almost the instant I began my run. I do have really muscular calves, and I thought maybe the shoes just needed breaking in, so I wore them all day for several days, but every time I tried running in them, the calf cramps returned. I think it’s just too much of a heel drop for me. I went back to my old worn out shoes and the cramps were gone, so I returned the shoes. My son runs XC and track and wears the men’s version of these and absolutely loves them. He’s on his third pair. I really wanted to love them, but I got the NB Roav instead and they are fabulous. I wouldn’t recommend these Vongos to anyone with large calf muscles.",Reviewed in the United States on 22 July 2020
"New Balance Women's Vongo V4 Fresh Foam Running Shoe, Light Aluminum/Lime Glo/Glacier, 3 UK",It's more sock than shoe & NOT for running or stability,"The reviews about the comfort of the soles made me buy these--and that they were listed for running and stability. I won't get to try out the soles because the shoes are useless for running etc.I have entirely flat feet with a wide toe box (loose ligaments.)  I need corrective shoes--orthotics aren't enough.  New Balance let me run, but I gotta say, they are moving away from structure and support and overpronation--which is what this shoe was listed mistakenly to address.  It's a sock with no structure on top of a foamy platform.  I'd worry about ankles with the platform height.  The sole won't hold up to track or terrain, or even miles of grass.  Indoor shoes for $164?  So this is New Balance's new Sketchers-not-workout-line of shoes.Sizing was right on.  They look just like the picture--which is a step up from the vinyl models, but just barely.",Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2020
"New Balance Women's Vongo V4 Fresh Foam Running Shoe, Light Aluminum/Lime Glo/Glacier, 3 UK",Not At All What I Expected...,"I've never tried on a pair of Fresh Foam NB's before.  I read the reviews before buying them and overall, what I anticipated receiving certainly wasn't what I got.  They were the correct shoes and the correct size, but the second I stood up in them the question that immediately popped out of my mouth was, where's the foam?  There's next to no cushioning in these shoes and the instep is very narrow.  Needless to say, they are heading back to the return center tomorrow.",Reviewed in the United States on 24 August 2020
Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,"Lighter, more mesh/breathable, hopefully still just as durable.","In general, I haven't found any affordable toddler shoes w better traction than the Merrells on Amazon. My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see. I also think these are slightly wider and easier to step into than the M-Trail Chasers.They claim these are machine washable which is nice though I would probably just spray them down w a hose.Hopefully you found this review helpful.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 October 2020
Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,Concerned about durability,"Initially pleased with these shoes, but after only three months they are showing way more wear and tear than they should. Cloth around the top is fraying all around. My biggest concern though is wear metal loop that the start goes through. The loop is failing and looks like it will soon break rendering these shoes worthless.Update 3/2021: Velcro gave out, shoes falling apart, didn't even last a year.

Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,Love Merrell Kids Shoes!,We love these shoes for our girls! They are so sturdy and durable with great grip that makes them perfect for camping and hiking and even bike riding. They hold up so well they never look just destroyed like their other shoes do much more quickly with much less wear. We were excited to finally score a purple pair in the right size.

Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,"Great sole, but small and hard to put on.","I printed Merrel's size chart, ordered the widest available. The length was perfect, the opening for the foot is stupidly small. The market for good outdoor shoes for toddlers is such that I really had no other option and chose to keep them. They haven't become any easier, i.e. they've not loosened. Or maybe the toddlers feet are just keeping up with that. Again, great traction on the sole for serious hiking and rough terrain... But they really could improve the ankle fit (maybe this is the width component of the shoe, but whatever it is, I hope buying next year's size isn't as hard as it was this year).",Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2021
Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,Elastic cord ripped on first use,Disappointed with the quality especially at this high price as the elastic cord came undone literally the first time this shoe was used.

Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,Good but difficult to put on,My 3 star rating might be a little harsh but I have little patience when it comes to frustrating children’s items.

There are plenty of shoes my 3 year old can put on herself but she definitely can’t do these... I barely can.,Reviewed in the United States on 5 November 2021
Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,Sole on the toe came apart after wearing just one day,"I’m generally a lover Merrell shoes. So, of course I buy them for my children as well. I bought these for my son to use them on an extended camping trip (3.5weeks). He has a primary pair of Merrell shoes, and was going to wear these as his backup in case the others got wet. After one day of just walking around a state park (with minimal stress), I noticed that the front sole was coming apart. He wore these for a second day, and the sole was apart for a whole inch. I had to buy super glue. The picture shows the shoes after I glued them. We were still on our long camping trip and my son had to keep wearing the shoes so they are a little broken in now. Besides the sole coming apart at the toe, the shoes were great. This is the first Merrell shoe that I've been disappointed with. My son said that they were comfortable.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 July 2020
Merrell Kids&#39; Trail Quest Shoes,"Sturdy, good quy","Fits as expected. I bought them in 3.5 Wide size for my child, they were comfy and were gray for hiking in Yosemite.

"New Balance Women's Fresh Foam Altoh V1 Running Shoe, Grey/Blue, 7",I Love These Shoes!!!,"Bought these for running and had them for two weeks, before buying another pair just for work.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have had in quite a while.  I have flat feet and suffer from plantar faciisitis; I have a really hard time finding shoes that are soft enough to run in, as well as, stand in for 12+ hrs.  These shoes are great and the cushions and treads seems to be lasting very well.  For the running shoes, I have reached about 250 miles and my tread pattern matches my other shoes at this point. So I'm sure I will easily be able to get 400 miles out of them before needing a replacement pair.  For the work pair, I stand for 12+ hrs, and by the end of my shift I surprisingly have no pain anywhere in my feet or ankles.  It is incredible because usually I buy shoes and by the end of the I am in excruciating pain because of my plantar faciisitis.

Chaco Women's Odyssey blue Size: 10 UK,Chaco famed arch support in a cute water shoe with excellent toe protection,"My 66 year old flat feet require and adore the substantial arch support that Chaco is famous for.

Great toe protection for river walking...sometimes you gotta pull that kayak...and very attractive to boot. Super comfy and fits like a dream. I was concerned that the closed toe might be too tight for my usual size 5 in Chaco open sandals so I sized up to a 6 but that was too big. Returned that and ordered the 5...perfect fit and plenty of room for my arthritic toes and bunions in the roomy toe box. Highly recommended for flat feet, high arches and foot problems like Plantar fasciitis. BTW, for anyone annoyed by the long straps which are a classic Chaco feature enabling custom fit, the long end is easy to tuck between the elastic and the fabric at the back heel with no heel rubbing.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2021

Leider hat sich die Begeisterung gelegt: kurze Strecken (z.B. als Hausschuh) sind voll ok, aber sobald man etwas schneller werden möchte, rutscht man äusserst ungünstig innerhalb des Schuhs herum, durch die fehlende Fersenkappe kann man den Schuh sogar verlieren, falls es noch schneller werden sollte.

adidas Terrex CC Boat Shoes Mens,Functional and stylish!,"I debated these shoes and read so many reviews before I spent the money on them. I was planning a trip to Niagara Falls and knew I’d be getting wet and didn’t want to walk around with wet shoes all day. After reading so many mixed reviews — one bad, then good, then bad, etc — I have to say I can’t believe someone would write a bad review of these shoes. I’m not saying they’re perfect but you can’t beat these shoes for the money.Pros:They dry out quickly, they’re vented and they drain water, they’re stylish and they’re comfortable. I walked around NY all day in these and they were great. Are they as comfortable as my other running shoes? No but that’s not why I bought them. I bought them so they’d dry out quickly and they did. Everyone else’s shoes were still wet the next day. Mine were dry in a few hours and I didn’t put them in the sun  or anything like that. Just took them off when we got back to our room. They offered great traction while walking the wooden steps of Niagara Falls as I got drenched!Cons:They’re wide up front in the toe box which I LOVE because I have issues w my right foot and need extra room up front and these were perfect. Also, I didn’t tie these shoes once after initially tying them. They were plenty comfy right out of the box. However I read reviews of people saying they were slipping off their feet?! Did they not tie them?! Not saying someone else’s experience isn’t valid but I’m confused how this would happen. I can’t imagine tying these, let alone tying them tightly, and having them slip off your feet.And sure they’re not as comfortable as a more cushioned running shoe but these are WAY comfy for being vented water shoes. And you can always buy a cushioned sole to make them comfier.I’ve only had them for a few days but they were great for my trip and the traction was great on and off the walking tours we did. I like them so much they’re now an everyday shoe for me. We will see how they hold up in the long run but so far I’m very pleased with this purchase. Would buy again.",Reviewed in the United States on 15 July 2020
adidas Terrex CC Boat Shoes Mens,Lake goers and boaters... GET YOU SOME OF THESE!,"I was skeptical when buying these shoes. I use them for fishing while I'm on the boat.

adidas Terrex CC Boat Shoes Mens,Good shoe but sizing is slightly off,"I’m a religious buyer of Adidas so when I saw these I had to have them for the summer. Why I found is they aren’t as floppy as they look in the photo, so that’s a good thing, but the sizing was slightly off. I’ve been a size 12 since I was 14 years old and that hasn’t wavered, but I needed to return the 12 for a 12.5 as my toes were cramped up against the front of the shoe. The 12.5 fit great and I’m looking forward to getting in the water with these.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 April 2021

Merrell Range Laceless AC+ Women,"Usually fit a size 6, sneakers have some stretch so 5.5 was fine","I usually fit a size 6 in my footwear, but the size 6 would've cost a hefty hundred dollars or so more to ship to my area than the 5.5. I loved the cute colors on this sneaker so I decided to take the risk.The shoe is absolutely true to the pictures, and the colors just as beautiful and vibrant as they look on my monitor. There is a bit of stretch to the sneaker so the half size down didn't hinder me, though I would still say they're true to size and I will probably end up wearing these sneakers out a bit faster for buying smaller. If you're able, I'd recommend buying your regular foot size still.That said, I absolutely adore these. So cute! They seem to have decent cushioning/support, comfortable, though I've been saving wearing them  for an upcoming trip, so I can't comment on long term durability.

The size 9 fit tight enough, they won't slip and slide while my feet are wet.",Reviewed in the United States on 19 July 2019
"Merrell Women's Hydro Moc Water Shoe, Black, 7.5 UK",HALF SIZES: ORDER 1.5 SIZE DOWN,"I love the shoe. However, there needs to be some more transparent disclosure on sizing. On Amazon, they make it appear that this shoe comes in half-sizes. It does not. I read in reviews that these run large, and sizing down is a good idea. I am an 8.5 medium, so ordered size 8. HUGE. Turns out when I ordered an 8.5, it was an 8, and I needed to downsize to a 7. I like the shoe, so am exchanging to a 7. If you are between sizes, order 1.5 size down. Know that if you order an 8.5, you are ordering Merrill size 8, which is a whole size too big.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2021

I received many compliments on the previous and decided to purchase their new range when these came out.These shoes are extremely stylish and very comfortable. It also fit true to size which is something i have not found to be common in the US. Extra care was taken with the packaging and boxing which I appreciate and the seller was very responsive to questions I had prior to purchase.I know that many of us find ourselves in a remote working environment and as such, there is not a defined dress code for shoes (since no one sees your shoes in a zoom meeting), but honestly, it really felt good to just get something stylish for myself again and felt good in wearing these.Highly recommended :-)",Reviewed in the United States on 28 September 2020

After 56 years of buying strictly white sneakers, I really had to think out of the box for this purchase.  Fortunately, I did, and I love my new, blue shoes!!!  Realistically, I purchased these shoes for better comfort when walking.  I'm an avid walker, and my most recent walking shoes have not been a great fit for walking.  Plus, they were falling into poor condition.  Naturally, my first objective was comfortable shoes for walking.  However, when I found these colorful, retro blue shoes, I couldn't resist.  I've never owned a pair of shoes anywhere near the color of my purchase, but I'm so proud of them!  They look and feel great!!  Of course, in the beginning, as with all shoes, you must ""break"" them in.  The more you wear them, the more the comfort increases.  I have been walking in mine for about three weeks, and they're just now starting to offer the comfort and support I expect.  The look and color get immediate attention.  The first time out of the house , my good friend immediately noticed and was complimentary!  I have a weekly walking group on Tuesday night, and the first time I  wore these shoes, every person noticed and made favorable comments.  The bottom line;  nice, comfortable, colorful, fun shoe!!

Why I rate these low has nothing actually do to with the shoe or the wear...I rate them low because I bought these for $29 dollars the first time and $32 the second!

I can barely get these tied, they come undone every few hours. Double knotting is impossible. You will need to buy new shoelaces. I haven't bought new laces yet because I'm lazy, I've just been dealing it. But it's seriously ridiculous. Can barely tie a basic knot, it'll only be down to the plastic tipped ends.I feel like Adidas can invest in more.... universal length laces.

These started to rub my heels just as I was walking around the house trying them.More like walking shoes than running shoes.",Reviewed in the United States on 20 July 2020
adidas Pureboost DPR LTD Men US 9 Multi Color Running Shoe,Good running/ walking shoes,"These Adidas Pureboost DPR running shoes are really comfortable, breathable, lightweight and fit true to size. Wouldn't use these for longer runs but works well for walking, gym sessions or casual to moderate running. The tongue could be improved to something thicker/ more substantial. Adidas did include a decent insole which isn't the case with many running shoes. They have the same boost tech in the more expensive Adidas running shoes.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 December 2018

   We are creatures of habit and I got on here to purchase my usual pair of running shoes. Since the pain in my knee was more often that tells me it’s time to replace the running shoes. These were off to the side as a recommendation so I checked them out after reading the reviews and watching the video I thought I would give them a try. I have a torn meniscus and arthritis in my left knee and the support sounded appealing. So glad I did!!!  Everyday midway through my walk I typically experience some knee pain. I have not had any pain since I received these shoes a few days ago!!🙂",Reviewed in the United States on 27 April 2021

KUBUA Women's Road Running Shoes Arch Supportive Breathable Sneakers beige Size: 6 UK,"Too short, strong glue and rubber smell","Purple color is pretty.  The toe area is very narrow.

I have a narrow foot and my American size is 9.5 narrow according to the measuring devices we have in the US. I have to get size 11 for anything made in China, but their patterns are variable and inconsistent. There is a very strong overpowering glue smell, not a  good sign for those who are allergic to the glues and synthetic materials used in manufacture of this product.  The foot bed was not very cushioned, and felt very uncomfortable after a few minutes of trying them on.",Reviewed in the United States on 19 April 2021

I'm a nurse and work 12.5 hour shifts on the floor. These are super comfortable, with good arch support, and my feet and back feel so much better than in my old shoes. The side of the shoe did start to crease up a bit already, but that's irrelevant to me personally. I would definitely buy these shoes again. I'll probably get another pair or two soon, just in different colors. I did get size 9, which is half size up for me which was perfect. By the end of a shift my regular size shoes get too tight.I also got a pair of Brooks for comparison, and those are good too but of course more expensive at $180+, and these Kubua were easier to break in and more comfortable straight out of the box.Would definitely recommend, especially for anyone needing arch support and on their feet for a long time.

I don't recommend running in these shoes but if you need to buy a pair of running shoes for work or to walk around in get these shoes. The shoes I was looking at run from $149 - $199 for 1 pair and you can buy 4 or 5 pair of these. I also should note that I have really flat feet with a bad hip and after 1 day in these arch shoes my hip felt better. And they look awesome. Everyone I meet tells me how good they look.  Another note, they do run big but I wear a 7.5 and generally get an 8 like in Skechers or Adidas but they don't seem to sell half sizes. I got the 8 and it is a bit big after about 2 weeks of everyday walking. It fits like an 8 not a 7.5 if that helps.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 May 2021

They are cushiony but with a little harder sole that won't give me pain like other Sketcher's cloud shoes do (they don't work well on my feet when I'm standing). I took one star off because they were a bit wide for my narrow feet and my left shoe felt off-balanced. It's been 3 months and still holding up well. I would love it if they come in more modern colors (like Dark Grey, light grey with white/black accent instead of bright yellow or pink accent) and sleek design.

But now after breaking them in a bit, they are my new favorite. They have good arch support and I find them extremely comfortable. They are not the most attractive shoes, but I’ll take comfort over fashion any day. Think I’m going to have to order a second pair. I usually wear a 6 1/2 or 7.

CREPUSCOLO Men's Moccasins Slip-On Loafers Sneaker Soft Flat Synthetic Leather Boat Shoes for Men Black Size: 7 UK,Reklamation,"Guten Tag, die gekauften Schuhe entsprachen meinen Vorstellungen, sie sind bequem, ich trage sie sehr gerne.Die Verarbeitung ist nicht so gut, es müssen andere Kleber verwendet werden..Da ich im Sommer Sandaletten getragen habe, nutze ich sie nun öfter.Leider löste sich an beiden Schuhen seitlich die Sohle. Ich habe vergessen zu fotografieren und habe sie desshalb sofort von einem Orthopädieschuhmachermeister reparieren lassen.Der Grund dafür ist, daß ich in diesem Jahr 5 HüftOP hinter mir. Damit ist eine Beinverkürzung rechts um 3 cm eingetreten. Deßhalb mußte ich rechts die Sohle erhöhen lassen.

"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Good buy!,These are nice looking and super soft on the feet. They feel like you are wearing slippers and they fit as expected.Good buy!

"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK","So happy with them,I bought a second pair!.","It isn't easy finding a good fit when you wear wide sizes, but these are great!",Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2017
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Perfect fit right out of the box!,"I have looked for a pair of nice black walking shoes to replace my current pair and they all looked too bulky...aka ""old lady"". When I found these, I decided to give them a shot. These shoes fit perfectly (10 M) right out of the box. In addition, they are very light weight, very attractive and very well made. I wore them and walked back and forth to check for rubbing, pinching etc....totally comfortable with a wide enough toe box and this is with medium thickness socks. These shoes are pre-treated to discourage stains since they are suede and the tag says that they are washable...we will see. I have never cared for the heavy white athletic shoe look, so this shoe goes with clothing much better.I like these shoes so much that my husband suggested that I go ahead and purchase a second pair since so frequently companies will either stop selling something or they will change something.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2018
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",These Shoes Are My New Best Friend!,"Ah! I am sooo glad I discovered these shoes. I have very wide feet due to bunionettes on both feet, and most shoes, even ""wide"" width, are not wide enough to be as comfortable as I'd like. The first time I ordered a pair of these shoes, about a couple of years ago, I got the C/D width, never dreaming that I could possibly need anything wider. They were very comfortable, but I still saw the outside edge of my foot pushing out beyond the shoe. I figured I'd have to live with my ""problem"", because I was sure that anything wider would be TOO wide for the rest of my foot. I took a chance and ordered this pair in a 2E, and I've come to realize that I actually DO need a 2E! It pays to measure your feet, or have them measured for you. I think many folks are wearing the wrong size shoe! These are perfect.... I no longer see the outside of my foot trying to push over the side of the shoe, and they're not too big elsewhere. The Propet Washable Walkers fit so perfectly, it's like they were made for me! I've since ordered 2 more pairs in different colors, as these are now about the only shoe I wear. They are great-looking, well-made, comfy, supportive, not ""heavy"", and they are washable! What's not to love?",Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2012
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",The cut/style of this shoe must be different because they were too tight,"My wife loved the design/color of the Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Classic Taupe; however, she had to return them because they were too small. All of her shoes are 10 M, and she received a 10 M size this time also; however, the cut/style of this shoe must be different, because for some reason they were too tight on her feet. She was disappointed because apparently they do not make a size 10.5 M and she was doubly disappointed that she had to pay the return shipping of $16 (over 20% of the cost of the shoe). Buyers beware.",Reviewed in the United States on 7 June 2017
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Tender Treatment For Touchy Toes,"Loved these so much, I stocked up. Comfy and warm to toes on chilly days without bulk. Wore them after broken foot bone healed. Have had no pain or arthritis in foot from injury since. I have actually fallen asleep in these. Look like suede but go in the wash. Sole is flexible so feet and ankles don't get stiff from an overly rigid shoe. Designed to gently make your foot do the work. Good for your tired dogs. Soothing to your feet.  Propet tends to run narrow-you may want to size up, though my first pair were a B width, have had some foot swelling since first pair, so I got the  E or W ( either designation is for wide).",Reviewed in the United States on 16 June 2017
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Very nice but run large,"Wish I had known they run large. I don’t require wide size, however my feet tend to be more wide than narrow.  Did not realize until I had worn these for a while that they rub my toe because they are just a tad too wide.I’ve solved the problem with thick soxs  & a wrap on toe, but if ordering again would order half a size smaller.Actually, I may order another pair in a different color because they are very comfortable.",Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2018
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Toe is tapered,This is a nice looking shoe and looks like it would be very comfortable IF you don’t need a wide toe box.  Sneakers with narrow toes don’t make sense to me.  Tried an extra wide width to see if that would make it work but still too narrow in toes and too wide in heel.,Reviewed in the United States on 27 January 2021
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Denim shoe is very attractive,"The shoe arrived quickly and in good condition.  We ordered a ""9 Narrow"" and noticed that the shipping email indicated that a ""9.5 Narrow"" was to be shipped.  Contacted Matt @ Orthotic Shop by email and he responded immediately, indicating that he would attempt to change the size prior to shipping.  He wrote back later that same day and told me that he was unable to intercept the order.When the shoes arrived, my wife loved the look and the feel.  The fit was just a bit roomy for her narrow foot but the shoes were very comfortable to wear.  She is keeping them.  Maybe the Propet denim sneakers run a half-size small.  The workmanship appears to be quality work.  My wife will use them as walking shoes and as a fashion accessory -- they are dressy enough to wear with both jeans and good slacks.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 February 2013
"Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Black Suede, 4.5 UK",Very comfortable,"I've only worn these shoes once because I bought them to wear in colder weather.  We've just entered Fall and the temps are dropping so I'll soon be wearing them more often.  I bought this shoe in a ""double wide'.  I've never bought or owned a pair of shoes in that width so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I like the extra room in the toe box and I'll be able to wear thicker socks once it gets cooler outside.  I treated the shoes with a protectant so they should be good for the entire season.  I like the neutral color and I'll be able to ""pair"" them with many different outfits.  So far, they're very comfortable and I'm looking forward to getting years of use out of them.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 September 2013

Harley-Davidson Men's Bill Steel Toe Harness Boot,Quality boots!,"Of the choices on fit, I had to choose ""Somewhat Small""...HOWEVER; if you do not have a tall foot (high in-step or 'club' foot), these boots fit perfectly. I wear size 9 1/2 boots...and these ARE 9 1/2 boots. My issue is the clearance at the top of my feet---pretty tight and taking a while to break in; so just be aware of that if you have a tall foot. That is my own problem. If I had a chance to try them on before buying, I MAY have gone a half a size up if it meant the top of the boot was more comfortable, but it's too hard to tell without physically comparing the two sizes.These boots get 5 stars, because (aside from my tight at the top issue) everything about the boots screams quality. First of all; I've always been a fan of Wolverine's, and that's who makes them (their web address is stamped on the bottom of the boot). Secondly, the materials, stitching, build, weight, and looks are all flawless on the pair I received. And last, but not least, these boots (for me any way), are so cool they give you a 'cool confidence' when you put them on...kept clean, they can be worn for any occasion from weddings & funerals, to Rock concerts and Rodeos.By the way; leather is not water proof (never has been, never will be)...best thing to do to make them as water ""resistant"" as possible, is to get some Mink Oil or any other leather treatment product, and treat them. They will repel water better, and last longer.I DO ride a motorcycle...but I don't think you have to be a motorcycle rider to own these boots. If you like good quality boots, buy a pair.",Reviewed in the United States on 14 July 2018
Harley-Davidson Men's Bill Steel Toe Harness Boot,"Boot is great, but ......","So the actually boot is good, seems to be built well, pretty comfortable,  and for being a saftey shoe, the toe box is roomy and doesnt cramp my toes. My issue is buying shoes online. The fist boots i bought were to big, so i had to return them, however there wasnt an option to return and get a different size! I had to start a return, which by the way took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, then buy ANOTHER pair of boots in a different size. These fit better, but are still a bit too loose, but honestly i cant any longer because i meed saftey boots for work. That wardrobe plane they offer didnt work for me because amazon does not accept debit cards on that service.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 May 2020
Harley-Davidson Men's Bill Steel Toe Harness Boot,Awesome safety and riding boots!,"Only had for one day so far, but have had them on for 10 hours  and my feet feel great. Fit fine right out of the box. Put some mink oil on last night for water proofing and with the steel toe my company covers part of the cost as I can wear them for safety boots as well as riding boots. I don't believe I will be invoking the 30 day comfort guarantee. Real nice boots for any price, but this is a great price. **** Less than 2 months and the leather is like ""peeling"". They have never been scuffed but there's like a thin shin peeling on the toe of both boots. I tried polishing to seal them better and the slightest buffing caused the top layer of the leather to wrinkle and tear. Just the thinnest layer. Still the most comfortable boots I've ever worn! Lets see what they will do.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 August 2017

I have a tough hike coming up and I bought these to train for it and I took it on ONE 10 mile hike and the bottoms were worn down completely and one sole was coming off.

I normally wear an 8.5 to a 9. My smallest and biggest toes were visible through the side fabric of the footbox because they are so small. The padding under the ankle was so tight that it was painful, even after loosening the shoe laces. These are by far the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever tried on.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 May 2021

"Propét Women's Ingrid Snow Boot, Black, 5.5 UK",Not a great boot,I have bought this brand before and found it was great for the 4e width I need. This boot is tight so if you need 4e be prepared. It also doesn’t keep your feet warm after an hour outside. I wouldn’t buy this boot again.,Reviewed in Canada on 9 December 2021
"Propét Women's Ingrid Snow Boot, Black, 5.5 UK",Get half size or full size up,"I have short and very wide feet and it is very difficult to find any womens shoes and boots in 4e. Originally ordered in 6.5 extra extra wide (4e) from a different store. It was pinching at the part where the rubber is sewn with the leather so they went back. I was very happy that I found the same pair here on Amazon so I ordered a 7-4e. The half size does make a difference. It does not pinch, but I would like a little more room for even just a regular pair of socks. I cannot wear a 7.5 otherwise it would look like clown shoes on me. I'm hoping they stretch once I've broken them in. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the fit. I don't believe they are an actual 4e, they feel like any other 7 wide in stores.",Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2021

ISOTONER Zenz Women&#39;s Elastic Sport Knit Slip-On Walking Shoe,Cushiony Support,"I have back problems as well as foot issues. I cannot walk comfortably barefooted or even in most basic slip on shoes. I needed something that not only supported my feet, provided stability, but would also be comfortable to wear all day. I am retired and was looking for a shoe to slip on in the morning and wear all day around the house, outside doing yard work or to run and errand. These shoes have definitely made a difference. From the moment I put them on my back felt better, I was able to remain standing for a greater length of time and when I went to bed my feet and legs weren't throbbing from the stress of being on my feet.

I searched high and low for indoor footwear with good cushioning, traction and comfort that actually stayed on my foot after having surgery on both knees and was dissatisfied time after time UNTIL I FOUND THESE! As soon as I received these isotoner zens stretch satin slippers I didn’t want to take them off! (Now my only problem is having to buy another pair to wear on errands!!) They feel like a big bear hug for my feet! They have super soft cushioning, are very light weight, so so soft on the inside, have great traction on my wood and tile floors so I no longer feel the instability (and the pain that come with) of slipping ever so slightly while walking. Honestly the best things I’ve put on my feet in a very long time... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I normally wear a 7 1/2 or 8 depending on the shoe and I got an 8 that fits perfectly (without socks although I couldn’t imagine wearing socks with them as the entire inside is plush and cozy but not annoyingly so like some slippers) love, love, love!",Reviewed in the United States on 21 February 2019
ISOTONER Zenz Women&#39;s Elastic Sport Knit Slip-On Walking Shoe,"THE Best Ever, but a word of caution...","These shoes are exactly what I needed because of aging sever arthritic feet where flexibility inhibits walking as I once did . Everything about them is the most comfortable, like keds were when we were young, washes beautifully, and aids in a very easy on and off format. However on asphalt the soft gripping sole which is a very big plus, must be considered to be dangerous on  certain surfaces as they grip and as in todays experiences, I  fell on my driveway hitting  my head and face ,badly bruised and realized the sole got stuck because of the texture of blacktop, that is pebbley, due to weathering. Dragging feet can happen with us all and that must be something to watch for with these shoes. Not a criticism but an aspect of how things are very beneficial but also need o be used with care..This aspect can be noticed by pushing  on the sole and indent it easily ..All in all a very difficult aspect of a perfect shoe but consider all limitations and be careful in them.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 June 2019

"Bloch Girls Super Jazz Shoe, Tan, 12 Little Kid",Very nice.,"Update:  Yikes!!!  I ordered two pair of Bloch jazz shoes from the warehouse.  Two different sizes.  They looked the same to me upon arrival.  My granddaughter refused to wear the first pair she tried on yesterday evening.  That review is below.  Today she wanted to try the other pair.  They fit and she likes them.  Then she proceeded to show me how the two pairs are different.  The pair she likes have the Bloch logo inside the shoe.  The first pair she tried on did not have the Bloch logo.  The color was not quite identical and the seam lines are  not the same.  The toe on the unbranded shoes is gathered, not smoothly wrapped under the toe.  I would include pictures if that option was still available.  We received one pair that is NOT a Bloch jazz shoe.  In fact, it does not have any brand name on it anywhere.  The size is stamped where the logo should go inside the shoe.  I have updated my review to five stars.  The Blotch shoes are very nice.Original review:  My granddaughter has always loved her jazz shoes.  It was time to go bigger.  These are a different brand than I have purchased in the past.  I purchased these from the warehouse.  They fit.  BUT, the seam that goes around the arch and under her foot, was uncomfortable and she couldn't get them off fast enough.  She informed me they are uncomfortable and she will not wear them.  Perhaps they were returned to the warehouse because of a defect on the seam?  Or perhaps the seam placement makes this style less comfortable. They look fine to me and seem to be the correct size.  [These turned out to be another brand, not Bloch.]I have reordered jazz shoes in a different style for her to try.  Unfortunately, these will be returned.  The warehouse price was great.  I really wanted these to work.  Oh well.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 April 2020
"Bloch Girls Super Jazz Shoe, Tan, 12 Little Kid",Run large but otherwise no complaints,"I ordered these for my daughter to take dance class, and like tap shoes, I heard these ran big. I guessed the same for both shoe types and ordered a size up. These definitely run large, to the point that you can see where her toes are and the edge of the shoe is flat. They’re not the easiest to get on and I’m worried if we size down much she’ll just outgrow them quickly, and she doesn’t seem to mind the extra toe space, so we’re making these work. Otherwise I’m happy with the quality, just hoping they make it to class at the rate she’s wearing them around the house!",Reviewed in the United States on 3 September 2020
"Bloch Girls Super Jazz Shoe, Tan, 12 Little Kid",Cheaper than the studio,"Got them for my daughters jazz class.  The studio sells them at twice the price for the same exact shoes.  We tried shoes in the studio, so we knew what size to get.  My daughter wears a size 12 shoe with a little growing room and this is the same.  She has a little thicker foot, but not quite  a wide width and they are not too tight with socks.  If you have a thin foot, they would have been too big and we would have needed an 11 or 11.5 in the shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2018
"Bloch Girls Super Jazz Shoe, Tan, 12 Little Kid",Runs very large and narrow,"My daughter is between a 10.5 and 11 in little kids regular shoes and I ordered both sizes. They were both huge on her. Sized down again to a 10, smaller than her shoe size and still too large. Tried a 9.5 and they are still too long, but now too narrow to be comfortable. Seems like a quality shoe, just won’t fit well unless you have narrow feet.",Reviewed in the United States on 5 August 2021
"Bloch Girls Super Jazz Shoe, Tan, 12 Little Kid",Runs a bit large,These were purchased for a GD who is beginning jazz dance classes.  I read through many reviews and purchased two different brands of shoes.  I ordered a size 12 1/2 in this brand and the GD wears a size 13 in regular tennis shoes.  These fit just a tad long but the width is perfect and they do not slip off her feet.  She will hopefully be able to wear these the full year.  They appear to be well made and are soft and comfortable for her.,Reviewed in the United States on 2 October 2019

RomenSi Womens Memory Foam Slip on Walking Shoes Tennis Running Sneakers (US5.5-10 B(M) All Black Size: 5.5,Not expecting them to last very long,"I just received these shoes and overall they're just ok.  You kind of have to expect to get what you pay for.  Unlike other reviewers, mine did not have a smell out of the package so that was a plus!  You can however tell they are SUPER cheaply made.  The mesh fabric on the back of one of my shoes is kind of sewn/stuck together funny and it creates a crease in the back of the shoe.  There is no tongue so when you pull she shoe strings, it creates a bubble on the front of the shoe.  I normally wear a 9.5 so that's what I bought and it does feel slightly large.  They are not the ""cutest"" sneakers.  The sole is a little bulkier than what I typically go for, but if you are wearing pants, it kind of covers the bulk.  I will probably not wear them with shorts this summer.I will say, these shoes are very comfortable and so far slip resistant.  I am a swimming official and am on my feet for 4-5 hours on a concrete and wet pool deck.  I have worn these 3 times so far and have not had any complaints about the comfort or slippage.

I assumed 10 Wide would be right in these too, but had to exchange for a 9 Wide. So they run extra large.Pros: lightweight, comfortable. Foamy midsole is comfortable for now.  Fairly classy looking with fresh jeans.Cons: lightweight (leather is pretty thin). Even in the Wide, the toebox is pointy and press my toes inward more than i would prefer.Decent kicks.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 December 2019

"Aerosoles Women's Term Paper Sneaker, Floral Combo, 3 UK","A++ Style, barely average comfort","Seller (non-Amazon through Amazon) was great, arrived earlier than expected, product was exactly as described.  Style is awesome, SUPER cute, baby blue canvas with the tiniest bit of shimmer in fabric.  Foot cushion/sole/bed is decent.  Canvas foot upper is super STIFF!!  So stiff it can be felt across top of foot when bending foot to step.  These are super cute though, so I'm keeping them to try to break them in...though I'm pretty doubtful that the bend is going to get any more flexible. I don't know if a shoe stretcher would help - I don't have one.  I like them enough to not return and give them a try, but if I'd have tried them on in a store, I wouldn't have purchased them.  Possibly this was a manufacturing issue for the style, which is a shame because they look so good - unless they surprise me by really breaking in well, I won't be walking for long distances in these.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 December 2021

I probably needed a 9.5. I returned them for a refund. I didn't replace them with a smaller size because I wasn't fond of the leather. In the pictures it appears to be a soft, supple leather, but I found them to be stiff & uncomfortable. Maybe they needed broke in? However, it's a very cute sneaker & considering that they're ""real leather"" at a good price, you may want to try them. I'd suggest ordering a half size smaller though.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 June 2020

I mostly use them as a casual sneaker, but have done some limited running.  They are very comfortable and are holding up nicely.  I have not owned any Reebok shoes in recent years.  I usually wear a size 10 in Nike and Under Armour.  These Reebok shoes are a little larger.  Perhaps a 9.5 would fit, but the size 10 is not bad at all.Edit:  Downgraded to two stars.  Within six months, these shoes started falling apart.  I only wore them about 2 days per week.  Not durable.",Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2019

The 9W felt a size longer. I went back and ordered size 8.5W. These felt narrow and still were a bit longer than regular size 10. I added for comparison photos side by side of Clarks Navy Leather size 8.5W and Sperry Tan Leather size 10M.",Reviewed in the United States on 2 December 2020
"Clarks Men's Forge Vibe Oxford, Tan Leather, 10.5 UK","They're Big, but Quality...","SIZINGFirst off, they're huge! I'm a 9.5/10 reliably. I got these in a 9, having read the many people who mistakenly bought their size only to discover these shoes are way way way oversized. Even at a 9, I was surprised at their footprint (no pun meant).When I sit them beside any other 9.5 footwear I own, these Clarks clearly tower past them. So look folks, buy 'em a half size down from what you normally wear.COMFORTStiff at first, but then, duh right? These are well-made shoes, so naturally they'll need time to open up and accommodate the nuanced geometry of your adorable feet. I've worn them now for about five hours at the office and they've already gone from, let's say, a 8 in stiffness to a 4. So, given a bit more time, they'll wear-in nicely. At first they also did made an audible ""pop"" sound, when folding at the toes as I open my stride. But again, when I say ""audible,"" I mean vaguely audible. I believe it's again related to their off-the-shelf rigidity. Once we beat on them a bit more, they'll surely become more malleable. Insole is soft and forgiving, without calling attention to itself as some kind of atom-splitting technology. I feel literally nothing invasive about these shoes. There is no ergonomics in design, for instance, that are stabbing my Achilles, or rubbing painfully against my well-moisturized, Irish-alabaster skin.APPEARANCELovely, unassuming, practical, wearable. Durable, well-built shoes, with rather understated style appointments. The stitching, for instance, around the sole is a nice rustic touch that appears durably manufactured. the bright(er) laces is a cool touch too, as it adds a nice contracting feature to their look. And the bone-colored sole is again a unsophisticated, but just declarative enough a treatment to call modest attention to them.FINAL VERDICTThey're Clarks, so there's that.  As Clarks go, these are a deal! Get 'em, gift 'em, wear 'em, paint the town in 'em (or the office)!",Reviewed in the United States on 11 November 2021

STQ Womens Lace-Up Water Shoes | Beach Swim Pool Aqua Sneakers black Size: 7-7.5,"So cute! / But seam could hurt heels / 5 Stars at first, now 3","These fit great. I am usually a size 7, sometimes 7.5 in athletic shoes. These have plenty of room. Easy to get on. I wore them around the house doing chores for two hours and they are very comfortable. I like that they are not the traditional water sock. They look just like athletic shoes but are very lightweight. 'Looking forward to wearing them on a beach this winter!Update:The main reason I wanted water socks /shoes is to minimize the sand getting between my toenails and cuticles.The first day I wore them during this, our beach trip, they were fine. Kept the sand out during the 2.5 mile walk along the beach. But the second day (similar to what James H. said), the seam in the inside middle of the right heel started to rub against my heel. By the third day, same thing on the left heel. There are seams on the inside heel. If they could be made without the seam in the middle of the heel, these would be great. When you are walking on sand, even compact sand closer to the water, the shoe will slip and then any seam will cause injury to the heel. I bought some gel heel insets, but they are curling and losing adhesion. It’s too bad because the shoes were doing what I wanted but also did something I didn’t expect.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2020

I only wore them less then 5 minutes and my feet were getting numb.  So you might wanna go with 2 sizes bigger.  If only they had half sizes.  Also if the shoes had a tongue on them it would be much easier to get on.  I guess I have fat feet.

I appreciate that the laces are not stretchy, which allows me to tie a tight double bow.  They have come untied during class a couple of times, but the band around the top of the shoe is snug enough that I do not have to stop to retie.

"Skechers Kids Boys Monster-GRYZOS Sneaker, Navy/Blue, 13 Medium US Little Kid",A MUST BUY!,"First let me start by saying I ordered these back 3 months ago and waited to review to test durability. My boys go through shoes like crazy, typically every 2/3 months their shoes are ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED and in need of new ones. I've tried several different top brand shoes (nike, adidas, underarmor, stride rite, ect.) And NONE of them held up to my kids except these. My kids play HARD and these shoes hardly even have scratches on them after 3 months!

These are very easy to get on and comfortable.,My husband has a neurological disease which makes it very hard for him to bend down and put on shoes and socks. The Velcro tab on a zipper at the top opens the shoe wide so he can easily slide his foot in.  And they zip up tight enough that his foot doesn't slide when he walks (with a walker). He says they're also comfortable. We were very pleased with this purchase.  I'm thinking of stocking up in case they become discontinued.,Reviewed in the United States on 11 March 2021

Reebok Men's Sublite Cushion Tactical Rb8805 Military & Tactical Boot black Size: 11.5 Wide,"Zero arch support, not a work boot.","At first, I put these on at home and stood up on the carpet in them. Ahhh... soft, memory foam. Light weight. Flexible. The side zipper is tight. The laces are thick. The leather feels like quality. Should be good right? Not so much. I'm 14 days in and I'm writing this with sore feet. Instead of writing you a story, I'm just going to list the problems with these boots...1) Memory foam is too thin, results in zero cushioning on hard surface while making your feet sweat profusely.2) No arch support. The inside is flatter than dollar store dress shoes.3) No side to side support. This means your heel will move, and since they are light and flexible, you'll likely roll your ankle.-All this can be solved with buying a nice insert from Sof Sol, like I did... except there is still one more COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE problem.4) Small cracks in the sole. Yes, water can leak up through the bottom of this boot between the tread resulting in wet feet (I hope that was water...) At least I didn't slip in it.There is one really big positive these though... The top of the boot, where it meets your shin and calf is really nice. There is nothing sharp or rough edged to make that uncomfortable in the slightest. I've tried a lot of boots over my years of military, contractor, and corrections... and the top half of these boots are best in the business. Too bad the bottom half is the most important.Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy and wonderful customer service!",Reviewed in the United States on 15 March 2019

They're BEAUTIFUL and have been pretty sturdy thus far (I received them on Wednesday).  My one complaint is how tight the shoe was on the top of my foot.  I attempted to loosen the laces to see if that would help, but it wasn't the problem.  The foam insert wasn't allowing my foot to fit correctly, causing it to be much too snug and creating pain.  Once I removed the insert, it was fine and still very comfortable.  **Note: I've never had a problem wearing Big Kids shoes since I'm overall tiny in stature.**  Nonetheless, I don't regret the buy!",Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2020

"Merrell Kid's Trail Quest Hiking Sneaker, Navy/Grey, 5 Big Kid W","Lighter, more mesh/breathable, hopefully still just as durable.","In general, I haven't found any affordable toddler shoes w better traction than the Merrells on Amazon. My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see. I also think these are slightly wider and easier to step into than the M-Trail Chasers.They claim these are machine washable which is nice though I would probably just spray them down w a hose.Hopefully you found this review helpful.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 October 2020

Would purchase again.",Reviewed in the United States on 24 November 2020
"Merrell Kid's Trail Quest Hiking Sneaker, Navy/Grey, 5 Big Kid W","Great sole, but small and hard to put on.","I printed Merrel's size chart, ordered the widest available. The length was perfect, the opening for the foot is stupidly small. The market for good outdoor shoes for toddlers is such that I really had no other option and chose to keep them. They haven't become any easier, i.e. they've not loosened. Or maybe the toddlers feet are just keeping up with that. Again, great traction on the sole for serious hiking and rough terrain... But they really could improve the ankle fit (maybe this is the width component of the shoe, but whatever it is, I hope buying next year's size isn't as hard as it was this year).",Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2021
"Merrell Kid's Trail Quest Hiking Sneaker, Navy/Grey, 5 Big Kid W",Elastic cord ripped on first use,Disappointed with the quality especially at this high price as the elastic cord came undone literally the first time this shoe was used.

"Merrell Kid's Trail Quest Hiking Sneaker, Navy/Grey, 5 Big Kid W",Good but difficult to put on,My 3 star rating might be a little harsh but I have little patience when it comes to frustrating children’s items.

There are plenty of shoes my 3 year old can put on herself but she definitely can’t do these... I barely can.,Reviewed in the United States on 5 November 2021
"Merrell Kid's Trail Quest Hiking Sneaker, Navy/Grey, 5 Big Kid W",Sole on the toe came apart after wearing just one day,"I’m generally a lover Merrell shoes. So, of course I buy them for my children as well. I bought these for my son to use them on an extended camping trip (3.5weeks). He has a primary pair of Merrell shoes, and was going to wear these as his backup in case the others got wet. After one day of just walking around a state park (with minimal stress), I noticed that the front sole was coming apart. He wore these for a second day, and the sole was apart for a whole inch. I had to buy super glue. The picture shows the shoes after I glued them. We were still on our long camping trip and my son had to keep wearing the shoes so they are a little broken in now. Besides the sole coming apart at the toe, the shoes were great. This is the first Merrell shoe that I've been disappointed with. My son said that they were comfortable.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 July 2020

These shoes really provide good support - for arch support and also helps with not pronating. My son has used these for only two weeks so Dont know how long it will last before the shoes get holes or components fall apart ( thatywhat happens to all his other pairs of shoes - from other big name brand.)

The olive green color isn’t included in the available options, so I thought at first that maybe the color was really off from what’s advertised. But then I noticed that an olive green perforated slip on is included next to the taupe slip on in one of the pictures, so I think the seller just sent the wrong color. The ones I’ve ordered do fit well (I’m an 8 and they’re true to size), and they’re really comfortable. Hopefully, if I reorder them in taupe, I’ll get the right color this time, and I can bump this up to a five star rating.

"Reebok Women's Realflex Train 5.0 Cross Trainer, Black/Infused Lilac/Coal, 5.5 M US",Not great for the RealFlex line.,"I've been buying Reebok's, specifically the RealFlex Reebok's, for the last 5 years and they keep updating their models and coming out with different new versions of the RealFlex shoes. I understand that they're a company and that they need to keep changing the model to come out with bigger, better product, but it's honestly such a pain to try and find new running shoes all over again when I can no longer find the style I like. I bought these in a 7 since my last pair was a 7 and they just fit different. They're really tight and narrow, and I don't even have a wide foot. They also run really small, so I'm not sure if I'd need a 7.5 or an 8. I can usually buy my Reebok's on Amazon no problem, especially when they're just the newer version of RealFlex, but this time I can't be lazy and have to go to various shoe stores and look for a pair. If you're used to the older styles of RealFlex I'd wait on ordering these online and try and find a retailer that carries them so you can try them on in person.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 October 2018

"Reebok Women's Realflex Train 5.0 Cross Trainer, Black/Infused Lilac/Coal, 5.5 M US","finally, the right shoe for me","I have been searching high and low for the right Zumba shoe. If you search the web, the most recommended Zumba shoes are light, and flexible, with smooth soles to allow for toe spins and dance moves. I've tried many of the most recommended shoes (Ryka, Asics, Nike, New Balance) but as I'm getting older, I feel less comfortable jumping without more support and cushion in my shoe. I tried the Reebok Trainettes, which I really like, but not enough support, Nike's are too narrow for my foot, which cause my feet to feel numb during class. I tried a more supportive running shoe, but it was too 'sticky' on the studio floor.

"ASICS Men's Gel-Kayano 27 Lite-Show Running Shoes, 8M, White/Pure Silver",Worst ASICS I’ve worn in 11 loyal years.,"I’ve been running Ascis Kayanos non stop since 2010.  I’ve gone through probably over 15 pairs and they are usually perfect.These ones suck.I was hoping there was just a break in period, but they actually got worse. My toes touch, the laces are too short, and they just don’t feel the same when pounding the pavement.I even looked into if these were knock-offs or counterfeit but it seems like everyone has similar experiences.

"Merrell Women's ALVERSTONE Hiking Shoe, Brindle, 7.5 UK",comfortable right out of the box; wide toe box perfect for me,"Very pleased with these Merrell Alverstone hiking shoes. I have flat and wide feet and ordered 1/2 size up from my usual and it's a comfortable fit. No more black toenails from smashing toes against the front of my shoe (yes, lacing the shoestrings correctly helps also). The Alverstone sole isn't as deeply grooved as the Moabs, and the Alverstone do not have the vibram sole, but I also paid $20 less for these shoes. I hope the Alverstones will last much longer than my Fila and Saucony walking shoes where the soles gets worn-out smooth after a 4-5 months of hiking once a week.I'm saving up money for a pair of $100 Merrell Moabs for better traction and grip. Merrell makes shoes that fit the shape of my feet; it's very hard to find comfortable and durable shoes that look good, as well. I want everything, haha!I purchased my Alverstones from Gear Coop, good seller. Earlier, I had bought the shoes from Zappos but got a defective/previously-returned item; one of the heels squeaked!

"PUMA Women's Carina Sneaker, White Black Silver, 3.5 UK",Okay,"I was looking for a pair of white sneakers with a bit of a platform and black stripes to style some outfits.  The shoe fits true to size, but you should wear with socks the back of the shoe scrapes a bit and will eat any invisible socks.  This makes the styling with office or casual wear a bit tricky.  The sneaker has a low platform sole but it still looks flat.  You also walk flat-footed as one does with sneakers so there is no elongation of your legs as one would like with a platform or a more elegant shoe.  I know recent trends style elegant outfits with all types of sneakers, I think these will remain in the sport/athleisure side of my closet.

"ASICS - Mens Solution Speed Ff Shoes, 8 UK, Cherry Tomato/Black","Great for tennis, really high end at a great price because of inexplicable reviews","I don't understand people leaving bad reviews here, I just got them, put them on and went to play. There is NO CLICKING sound, if anything they are sticky to normal floors out of the box and the sole makes a sound as you walk, it obviously goes away on sidewalks or at the court and will not last. To those who complained about the toes being too tight or the ankle loose...learn to tie your shoelaces! They come with a normal cross lacing out of the box and yes, my right foot was too tight at the top, a slight pull and it was actually hurting on the side a bit, not on the other foot, but this is not how you tie your tennis shoes, on these I just went one across and then under the sides one up and across etc, the other lace straight up through the middle but there are a couple of aceptable ways, watch a video or something. The toe box is tight and slightly rigid at the top and sides, as it should be for a better feel and traction, it prevents your toes to hit the edge and hurt and the fit is perfect on its own, no need to get it tighter but  at the top of the lacing, however, the last eyelet is low, use it with the laces crossed and that will not allow your ankle to feel loose, but comfortable and secure without feeling the shoe. I had no problems at all lacing them right. No noises, they stick to the court like I have not felt before, they are light but you feel support and protection. Lots. It's amazing how quickly you take off in this when changing dictections. Tennis Warehouse gives these one of their best ratings on a pair of tennis shoes that I have seen. I don't know what so many here are talking about.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 May 2019
"ASICS - Mens Solution Speed Ff Shoes, 8 UK, Cherry Tomato/Black",As expected from ASICS,"From reading some of the prior reviews I had second thoughts but went for this shoe anyway.  I saw that it made top ten for tennis shoes 2018 and decided to try them for myself and I am not disappointed.There was no noise or weird sound from this sneaker as I walked.  It was perfect out of the box.  I also gotta say, based on a previous review, you must lace your shoes properly and those negative posts will not matter.  And looks!!! Plenty of complements as soon as I was in the public eye.  They are a great looking.Performance is great.  I feel secured and supported in this shoe.  Toes are wide and comfy, but fit perfect.  My favorite thing about buying online is that I have been wearing an Asics running shoe for about two years.  I bought them in a physical store and got the perfect fit (I've always went with New Balance or Nike in the past because of width).  Here I ordered the same size without trying on the Speed FF ever.  Same fit & function that made me chose the ASIC over the others the first time.  These are ASICS and they rock.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is just based on price.  Amazon online shopping used to crush the stores on price, but this one was about the same.  The benefit was solely them coming to my door step, but I do recommend this court shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 July 2019
"ASICS - Mens Solution Speed Ff Shoes, 8 UK, Cherry Tomato/Black","It fits decently, but ...........","I use as a ""kick around"" shoe. I think I liked the looks of it the most.This tennis shoe is almost all rubber and lacks solid support for a tennis shoe. Like others have commented, it makes a strange annoying noise when I walk. It may be that it does not bend easily.With all the grooves, I thought it would breathe easily but it really does not breathe well!Also, with all the grooves on the toe area, it always looks dirty like there is a ton of dust in between all the grooves.Knowing what I now know, I would not buy this particular model again.However, I really like other Asics tennis shoes and will certainly consider them in the future.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 August 2019
"ASICS - Mens Solution Speed Ff Shoes, 8 UK, Cherry Tomato/Black",This can't be an asics shoe,"I always were Asics tennis size 11 and these were not only 1/2 size too small, but they were narrow and uncomfortable like a cheap Payless shoe. The heel slid around and I could not make the tight shoe even stay on my foot.I got a new size then wool socks since I like the design of the shoe but nothing worked. This is not asics. It did not feel like any of the dozens of asics shoes I ever bought.Asics is making great shoes and as soon as they make one, they discontinue the amazing product. Then they put out this garbage that is being discounted because it's a design flaw that they should take back from resellers.This experience frustrated me so much that I am heading out on a mission today to find a new brand of shoes that I can depend on that doesn't have lame colors I would never buy.Bye bye asics.

"ASICS - Mens Solution Speed Ff Shoes, 8 UK, Cherry Tomato/Black",This Is A Super Premium Tennis SNeaker,"The Solution Speed FF is clearly a premium tennis sneaker. The weight is 12 OZ (very light) and you notice the speed difference it makes, you are just quicker. The shoe fits well over my low volume foot with just a slight amount of too much width for my C-D wide foot. I must carefully tighten the shoe strings to get a close enough fit. I did get a popping sound on the left show for a few months  but it has dissipated after breaking in. Do not just  overlook this shoe because of the negative comments about popping, it isn't that big a deal to me at least and it went away for me. If you want to be faster, this a shoe to consider and it is reasonably priced. The sole grabs effectively and the ventilation is supreme as I sweat a lot and no issues with this shoe unlike others I have tried, it really breathes nicely. It may not be the ideal shoe for wet surfaces as my Adidas are better on wet surfaces. Works great on indoor gym floors or outdoor dry surfaces that I have tried,",Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2019
"ASICS - Mens Solution Speed Ff Shoes, 8 UK, Cherry Tomato/Black","Fit is good, back of show is a little too low","The toe area, arch and overall fit was what I expected (I have slightly wide feet and normally wear size 10.5, and I ordered 10.5).  Problem for me is the back of shoe -- the counter --  is a little too low.  This results in vertical movement of my heel when playing pickleball or tennis.  To compensate, I use the heel-lock lacing pattern,  but I have to pull the laces so tight it causes too much pressure on the top of my foot.  Will not buy this model again, nor do I recommend this model for pickleball or tennis.  Trying Gel Resolution 8 next...Dear ASICs,  what the h**l is going on?  Please bring back the Gel Resolution 7!  Stop tinkering, start improving.",Reviewed in the United States on 15 September 2020

"Under Armour Women's Breathe Trainer x NM Fitness Shoes, Blue (Breathtaking Blue/White/Halo Gray (300) 300), 8.5 UK",I love them,So I did read a bunch of reviews before I bought these so I ordered a size 7 and normal wear a 6.5 or 7 depending on the brand. I have really narrow feet so I went with the larger size that I normally wear with some brands. I will say when I first put them on I thought they might not work but the fabric of the shoes does loosen up a bit after you start wearing them. You have narrow and thin feet I suggest going up only a half a size unless you like looser fitting shoes.Moving in to the actual shoe. Absolutely beautiful true to color in the pictures. Extremely light weight. Very comfortable. Worth every penny.I am a caregiver for the elderly so I am in my feet a lot and I can tell you I have not gone home once with my feet hurting after wearing these shoes for sometimes longer than 24 hours straight. I am not at all disappointed in the purchase and I have received tons of compliments on them.,Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2021

"Mizuno Men's Wave Sky 4 WAVEKNIT Running Shoe, Frost Grey, 11 UK","A well fitting, well built, plush ride.","So first things, I'm not a runner, I'm a walker though.  I bought these during the prime day sale in the gray and blue color way.  These are incredibly comfortable and very cushioned.  I've been wanting to try Mizuno shoes anyway after owning brooks for a while.  The knit uppers are a bit thick so they aren't going to wear out soon, but conform well after walking in the shoes for a bit.  The half-bootie that wraps the sides of the foot and holds the tongue secure is very comfortable and unnoticeable even with thin socks.  The inside of the shoe at the toe is seamless thanks to the knit uppers and very comfortable and very foot hugging.  The heel area hugs well and keeps it from moving at all which is nice.  Overall the fit is very secure and the ride is very plush.  They do not have and stability control though so if you're an under or over pronator these shoes may not be for you.They are definitely true to size.  I ordered these in an 11R (which is also my size in brooks) and they fit spot on.  If you're looking for a very comfortable, plush, well built shoe, these are certainly a best buy.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 June 2021
"Mizuno Men's Wave Sky 4 WAVEKNIT Running Shoe, Frost Grey, 11 UK",Not just for running.,"I ended up being recommended these by a local running store based on my running needs at the time. When I started a new job in a concrete warehouse, I ended up falling back to these shoes for walking throughout the building. 10-15 miles of walking per day and these shoes hold up great. I ended up getting a second new pair direct through Amazon to replace my falling apart pair. I would say that for walking, you can easily get 600+ miles out of these shoes. They are comfortable, they support your feet, and even when you're a bigger guy like me they don't cause me to have aches and pains I find in other shoes.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 July 2021

I purchased the men's Wave Sky 4 Waveknit and have been vary happy the the cushioning and the ware characteristics of these shoes.  I purchased shoes made by Mizuno years ago and I don't remember why I did not continue with this brand.  However the Wave Sky 4 is a winner.  I purchased additional pairs one week after running in them.",Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2021

The cushioning is better this time too, and the outsole looks at tough as the previous version. The last pair (wave runner 3) had gone almost 700 miles of city walking wear and tear before being replaced. This shoe has minor improvements in the weight of the shoe, and the design of the tongue, collar and counter lining make for a better fit. The lace lock is a little high in my opinion, but hasn't been an issue so far.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 November 2021

We will probably only get half of the winter out of them.  I wanted to invest in Columbia since my child's school switched to an Outdoor Classroom this year because of COVID.  But these seem like beyond warm?  They are rated to -45 F / -43 C.  I am sure that snow boots don't need to be that warm.  I would never send my child out to play if it was -45 Fahrenheit!Because of the extra thick padding on the sides, these boots are extremely hard to get on.  My child had to shove and shove and shove his foot and hold onto my shoulders and shove some more.  And then repeat again with the other foot.  I have four children and have encountered my share of snowboots; these are harder to get on than is customary.  I can't imagine being the classroom teacher that had to help a whole room of children with these boots!My son is excited about them, and they will be warm, but unless they prove to be outstanding feature-wise or durability-wise, I don't plan to get them again.

"Timberland Amalfi Vibes Cross Slide, Men’s Sandals, Schwarz, 10.5 UK (45 EU)",Para Pies Muy Curtidos y Duros,"Las sandalias están bien. Es buen material, aunque la suela es algo dura.El problema está en el daño que producen en los pies. El acabado del cuero en sus bordes desgarra la piel de pies y dedos, lo cual va a hacer imposible que se calcen durante las semanas que la piel tarda en curar y crear durezas y defensas naturales.Se pueden poner tiritas y demás, pero duele igualmente.No soy de pies delicados: cada verano únicamente calzo sandalias de piel.Estas además no me quedan ni grandes ni pequeñas.

Reebok Women's Cloudride DMX 3.0 Grey/White Ankle-High Walking Shoe - 11M,"Great, comfy walking shoe - ideal for a wider foot","I bought these because I started a job where I'm on my feet walking on concrete floors all day. They are very comfortable! They do run a bit wide, and I have more narrow feet. The heel is extremely cushioned, which is great, but because the shoes are a bit wide for me, my foot tends to slide off of the cushioning and go forward in the shoe. So I'm probably not getting all the benefit of the extremely cushioned heel. The other thing is, the tongue of the shoe tends to migrate toward the outside of the shoe, which isn't the end of the world, it just looks weird, so I'm forever re-adjusting it. But again, this could be because my foot has some room to slide around in the shoe.I'd definitely recommend this shoe to someone with a wider foot. They are very comfortable and look fine with dark pants, if you're in an environment where you have to wear slacks.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 July 2018

I have played with these twice on hard court and I have had no toe jam and there is plenty of cushion. I tried the B width as well but those were a little too snug.

Just a little out there for an old lady but I like them.  The second pair fits great!  There are differences in where the shoes are made and who made  them and what day it is.  It’s a crap shoot.

Can't find out if it is a defect. Poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this. I got the extra wide 10.5 and it still feels a little tight. The shoe strings are too short. I had another pair of NB shoes in pass that the string whee too short. I have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie. That pair was from 5-10 years ago. Thought they would know by now to make their strings longer. I have a high arch, I don't know if that is the reason I need more string length, but this is the only manufacturer that I have run into this problem. If I but a pair of the mens I don't have that problem, just some of their women tennis shoes. I can't keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back.

"Cole Haan Women's Grand Crosscourt Turf Sneaker, Optic White Leather, 7.5 UK",Hit or miss with quality,"I had to re-order these shoes after the first pair arrived in pretty poor quality. The leather was incredibly creased on one of the toe boxes of the shoes, looking like the panels weren't sewed properly. You could see the stitching inside around the entire heel of the sole and there was a black stain on one of the shoes. Needless to say I contacted to Amazon unsure if these were authentic or fake Cole Hans, they assured me they were authentic so I decided to give it another shot and order a replacement pair. The second pair came in much better quality -- but do note that the leather is VERY paper thin and so there was still some wrinkling/creasing on one of the pairs. It was right where the toe box bends though so not as big of a deal. Also they do fit a little large so I sized down half a size (I'm usually a size 6 womens, I ordered 5.5)I haven't worn them for long periods of time yet, just around the house but here are thePRO'S:- Super light weight, comfortable- a beautiful clean, minimalistic look! more-so than Adidas Stan smith's- would make a great travel shoe, light weight easy to pack and would go with any outfitCON's- leather is pretty thin (hence why they're so light weight) so will need to see how these hold up",Reviewed in Canada on 24 January 2019

"Superfit Tedd Snow Boot, Grau/Blue 2000, 10 UK Child","Endlich  !!! Ein idealer Winterschuh auch für Frauen, die nicht ausrutschen möchten !","Als Berufspendler, der täglich lange Zeit mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln unterwegs ist und durch Wind und Wetter muss, habe ich lange nach einem Winterschuh gesucht, der meinen Ansprüchen gerecht wird:+  Die Sohle muss ein griffiges Profil haben, damit ich auch bei Schneematsch nicht ausrutsche.+  Außerdem sollte sie biegsam sein, damit die natürliche Abrollbewegung des Fußes nicht eingeschränkt wird.+  Sie sollte gute Bodenhaftung und deshalb eine möglichst große Auflagefläche haben (nicht so wie diese modernen halb nach oben gebogenen Fehlkonstruktionen)+  Der Schuh darf nicht durchweichen wenn ich durch ""Sauwetter"" und auch mal durch Schneepfützen muß,+  Die Füße müssen schön warm gehalten werden  (bei uns Frauen besonders wichtig!)+  Trotzdem sollte man auch bei einigen Stunden im warmen Büro keine Schweißfüße darin bekommen+  Und er sollte nicht zu klobig aussehen. Bei mir geht da das Praktische über das Modische ...Alle diese Punkte werden hier voll erfüllt. Ich habe sogar noch seitliche Bewegungsfreiheit, damit sich meine Zehen nicht zu eingepfercht fühlen, und man kann dank des Reißverschlusses schnell rein- und rausschlüpfen ohne mit steifen Eisfingern jedes Mal an der Schnürung herumfummeln zu müssen!!! Dadurch dass man (vorher) mit der Schnürung die Weite noch individuell anpassen kann, kann man die Schuhe auch mit dicken Socken tragen, wenn man will. Obwohl das Teddyfutter unten und innen rundum ansich schon mollig genug ist.Nur schade, dann man sowas nur unter der Rubrik ""Jungenschuhe"" findet und nicht auch unter Frauenschuhe  (ich trage Gr. 38, da passt das zum Glück noch). Also: klare Kaufempfehlung, auch für Frauen mit entsprechender Schuhgröße !!!!Ergänzung nach einem Jahr Tragen (natürlich nur bei Winterwetter):  Leider verabschiedet sich gerade das Innenfutter an der Ferse, bei beiden Schuhen, daher ziehe ich im Nachhinein einen Stern ab.

However, there seemed to be something different about the fit and the way these shoes balance on my feet and I am dissapointed and unable to wear them.  For some reason, they seem to be loose around the sides and stones are constantly getting in somehow (its hard to explain).  Also the left shoe fits a bit better than the right shoe.  The right shoe seems to throw my balance off so I tip to the right and I have developed a callous on my right foot since wearing them.  This has never happened before with previous Propet Vista Walkers.  I find I can not wear this pair at all unfortunately.  I have gone back to wearing my older Vista Walkers, same size, same brand and they are fine so no idea why the new pair is different to all the others I've purchased previously.  Its a mystery.

I have a wide foot and most tennis shoes seem to strangle my feet. However, the NMD R1 STLT provide the most comfortable fit of any sneakers I have tried. The knit mesh wraps around your feet and feels like you are wearing socks, while the boost sole gives a  responsive cushioning effect like you are walking on a cloud.I normally wear a size 11, but I purchased an 11.5 this is to compensate for the Dr. Scholl's plantar fascites insoles that I use in all my shoes.

Personally, I do street run or jog in a gym about 3 miles daily and this shoes can protect my feet very well. Also this shoes is flexible, it is easy to wear without taking care about shoelaces. For people who are long distance runners, this shoes can decrease the vibration when you step on the ground and protect you knees. It can help you to keep stability when you are running and increase your balance.What Size You Should Buy?This pair of shoes fit a little bit bigger than normal shoes’ size. But I still recommend to go true to size on this shoes, because when we are doing some sports or jogging, our feet will be bigger than normal. If we buy this shoes for a half size down, it may be a little small and hurt our feet.What features this shoes has?For this pair of shoes, its breathability is excellent. When I am jogging at gym, I feel fresh and cool on my feet. I am a person who is likely to sweat when doing some sports, this shoes can keep my feet dry and comfortable. But if say the ability of water resistance, this pair of shoes cannot resist water at all, and if I wear this shoes on the street for a long time, I will feel cold because this shoes is thin and light, and it is ideal for summer.This shoes uses Boost technology of adidas to makes the shoe sole flexible and comfortable, and it has a fantastic looking so that when the first time that I saw this pair of shoes, I said “this is what I am looking for”. For its durability, I heard that the shoes with Ultra Boost technology didn’t do well on it. But for Boost technology, I wore this shoes for jogging and daily use since I received it and it did great so far. We can expect this shoes can handle heavy duty jobs.Thank you for your time, and if you have any questions, you can leave a comment below and I will response as soon as possible.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 February 2019

Yes, just would make sure to order down half a size!Edit: I washed them in my washing machine, as white shoes don’t stay white forever, and not only did it clean them right up, but it also shrunk them just enough to fit even better then when I bought them! (Let them air dry!!) I left my original review so you could see what my first thought was. I am adding another star because these shoes (after washing them) are a really good shoe! They have also gotten more comfortable after washing and wearing more.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 May 2020
VAMJAM Men's Casual Athletic Sneakers Fashion Lightweight Breathable Mesh Running Shoes Size: 5 UK,"VERY painful, VERY bad for your feet, and VERY silly buy. DO NOT GET!!","This review is not a joke they are so bad for your feet it's absurd.Amazon should stop selling these.These shoes are for those who desire orthopedic surgery in the future, they are so bad I have let others try them just to see how bad they are. The feeling among my friends is you're better off walking barefoot unless there's glass on the floor. I then showed them to a podiatrist who said they were worse for your feet than any shoes he'd ever seen at payless. Please for your own good, especially if you have arthritis, do not buy these!!!!!!!!!",Reviewed in the United States on 18 May 2020
VAMJAM Men's Casual Athletic Sneakers Fashion Lightweight Breathable Mesh Running Shoes Size: 5 UK,Great shoes for the price,"I’ve been wanting white shoes for awhile now. Decided to get these in both high top and normal.  For the price you are paying you are definitely getting your moneys worth.  I will say you most likely will not be able to run in these.  Even tied I’m able to pull them off fairly easily, even the high tops. The material feels like gauze tape which is surprisingly comfortable.  I walked around in them and went to get the mail and experienced no problem with the shoes.  I got these more as a statement piece.  Hence the super gay socks and pink shorts lol.  I will be wearing these to the gym and maybe out events.  I’ll most likely be ordering in other colors as well. I don’t expect these shoes to last a long time as it feels as if you could cut through the entire shoe with scissors but at this price I most likely won’t mind replacing them.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2020

I’ve had so many people compliment me while wearing them. I will however warn you that the ankle support is nonexistent. When I first wore them, I nearly rolled my ankle thinking it was like my normal sneakers. They are as depicted in the photos. Soft and flexible but have a really clean shape to them!

But these! Will not help me in anyway working out. The foam soul has zero traction, I could see myself slipping on the tiniest of water droplets.

Brooks Womens Range Running Shoe - Oyster Mushroom/Alloy/Fiery Coral - B - 6,Disappointed,"Well I bought these shoes, because I've read & been told how good Brooks shoes are.  So I figured I'd give them a try.  The side of the sole digs into the side of my foot.  As soon as I put the shoe I felt it.  As my first pair of Brooks I was disappointed.  Maybe the kind I got had a bad cut or glue job.  The shoe also seemed a bit more narrow than what I was expecting. Either way I will be returning, and probably won't try the Brooks brand again.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 May 2021
Brooks Womens Range Running Shoe - Oyster Mushroom/Alloy/Fiery Coral - B - 6,Not for narrow feet after all,"These did not work for me. I have narrow feet (usual size 10N) but since reviewers said these ran narrow, I decided to try them. I ordered a half size up as recommended, so 10.5 medium. They were very roomy and looked large on my feet. They seemed comfortable enough at first try-on, though, so I decided to ignore my vanity and keep them. Yet after wearing  for several days straight doing remodeling work on my house, I found I had heel pain at night. Decided to return and order another style in 10N since the Range does not come in that size. If you normally wear a narrow shoe, I do not recommend these. I would also say you do not need to order a half size up. These fit like a 10.5 medium, as listed.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 June 2021

I tried 3 different pairs and sizes of this same shoe and every pair creased in the toe area and rubbed my toe the same way (see pictures). I only wore them around my home for about 30 minutes and the crease became too uncomfortable. Sadly have to return and will have to find another more comfortable model.

I've been using them for nearly 10 years, and I've loved every pair I bought. Sadly, this pair doesn't sit straight on one of my feet. The left shoe slips outward while walking/running. I've never had that issue with a shoe. I walk for work, and on my first day put 5 miles on this shoe, trying to right it as I went the whole day. It's as if the cushion on the bottom was displaced slightly or is wonky, like a pillow you've put in the dryer. I wish I could return them, since I paid $60. Their okay for driving, which I also do for work, so I keep them handy for that. But I'm disappointed in Brooks at this point.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 June 2021

Speed TR,Buen producto,Los uso para entrenar CrossFit y al momento han cumplido el objetivo.,Reviewed in Mexico on 17 September 2021
Speed TR,"Fits a little small or snug, but what I expected as I have a 2nd pair","I love this shoe, it's my 2nd pair (different colour).  It does fit a little snug across the width, but what I expected.  Shipping took a little longer than expected.",Reviewed in Canada on 13 December 2021
Speed TR,Sizing,Size runs a little long. Half size too long.,Reviewed in Singapore on 2 December 2021
Speed TR,Holy Grail Shoe.,"This is the best all around fitness shoe I’ve owned. Speed TR’s can do it all, I’ve done everything from squats to short runs to playing basketball in these and they handle it all more than capably. They don’t look too bad when worn casually either. Buy them.*Edit* Still love the fit and look of these shoes, but the outsole wears away very quickly. Wore them for about 3 weeks and chunks of the grip started tearing away.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2021
Speed TR,Cheap construction,I had a previous pair of these years ago that I loved. This pair were very flimsy and felt extremely cheap.,Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2021
Speed TR,These feel a little loose,"I have worn almost everything in the Reebok crossfit area of shoes and these fall into that same great on the turf, in the gym but not so much on the street shoe. They are hard on the bottom which makes them great for Olympic lifts and turf work but anything more than 400 a meter sprint and I don't think you will like this shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 2 May 2021
Speed TR,Great style Terrible  quality,"They fit as expected, I really like the color and style.Very disappointed of these shoes as I was expecting them to last a lot longer.Only 3 1/2 months of using them and they are already starting to get a hole on the mesh as you can see in the pictures I uploaded.Not what you are expecting for $90 shoes designed for crossfit.The mesh material seems is not able to be made for some intermediate workouts.Do not waste your money on shoes that  you will not be able to get not even a quarter  of it supposedly lasting life.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 April 2021
Speed TR,Great shoes very stable with solid grip,"These shoes are great and are very stable for speed work, and changes of direction when doing sprints. They also have a very solid and stiff sole which is ideal for having a solid base when doing strength training. If you have the ankle mobility to do squats without needing the wedged lifting shoes these are going to give you a very stable base. My only complaint is that the inserts don’t quite fit against the inside of the show on the side with this pair and it pinched my heel a little bit the first time I wore them. After tightening the laces a little different I was able to fix that issue. Overall I’m happy with them, and would recommend them to anybody looking for a training shoe. These are definitely not ideal for distance running though!",Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2021
Speed TR,Awesome for “Fat” Feet!,"I love these Reebok sneakers. I’ve been a long time wearer if the Reebok Nano, but the newer models have become more narrow.I was worried at first, but the puppies have plenty of room in the “toe box” area for my hobbit feet! Feel great in the gym for my heavy lifting as well as my plyo-metric work. I use them occasionally for casual wearing also.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 November 2021
Speed TR,Bummer,"An earlier model of this shoe we’re my favorite pair of gym shoes ever, I was super sad to receive these — much cheaper materials and not the same feel — toe box was narrower and I could tell they were going to fall apart quickly — they were sadly an instant return",Reviewed in the United States on 4 July 2021
"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK",Adorable but size is COMPLETELY off,"These are super cute and appear well made. However, I'm a true 6 but read the other reviews and ordered the 6.5 just in case. Not only are the shoes too small, but I legitimately cannot even get my foot inside them! These are labelled ""6.5"" but they are clearly no bigger than a 5.5, maybe even a 5. If you must buy these, order at LEAST a size up, if not more - but honestly I would not recommend buying them at all, because if they can't get something as simple as the shoe size right, I would be surprised if the actual construction of the shoe held up.",Reviewed in Canada on 17 March 2021

"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK",Color wears off very quickly!,These shoes are very comfortable but just after a few days I started noticing the green color fading off and the white cloth underneath coming through which made the shoes very spotted and looking very odd.  More and more keeps fading off each day.  I am very disappointed especially because they are not inexpensive shoes.,Reviewed in the United States on 15 March 2019
"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK",I know everyone loves these but.....,"I wanted to love these soooo bad because they are so stinking cute!!! BUT as hard as I tried they just were not comfortable to me. Standing in them for 2 minutes and my feet would just hurt. The footbed was too hard. I even bought a wonderfully thin soft memory foam insert (so the shoe didn’t fit too tight and I ended up keeping the insoles because I loved them) but I found no relief. I had such high hopes for these from the amazing reviews, but I had to send them back. They were true to fit. They weren’t narrow (and I have wide feet- so that says a lot) and the length was fine. They were just hard and made my feet sore. But many other people I know love them. Hope you have luck with them!!",Reviewed in the United States on 24 September 2019
"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK","Cute, comfy, but watch sizing","Came brand new in adidas shoe box. They’re super cute! I ordered an 8. They fit comfortably but if you like a bit of extra space between your toes & the end of the shoe, id say to order a 1/2 size larger than usual. These will make great nursing shoes. Very comfortable to walk in.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 August 2019
"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK",Finally a good fit!,"I have purchased and returned many pairs of black sneakers over the past several months (thanks Amazon Prime) because all my usual brands (Puma, Asics, Reebok) have either changed in sizing or quality. I usually wear size 8.5 to 9 in sneakers and got an 8.5 in these based on reviews. The fit of these Adidas are exactly proportioned to my feet: wide at the toe box for my mild bunions; close-fitting and supportive at the arches for my flat feet; and narrow at the ankle to keep from slipping. The fabric is cool and stretchy without feeling cheap, but I will have to wear a different, more water-resistant pair for rainy days. I also like the subtle black-on-black print, black sole, and wide laces. Finally, a keeper!",Reviewed in the United States on 28 January 2020
"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK",Light Weight - True to Size - Comfortable,"These are my 2nd pair I've bought. The newer Edge Lux are made from recyclable materials, and were so tight that they hurt. They were so cute on, but I couldnt get past the way they felt. I found these shoes online since I cannot find them in stores anymore, and they are exactly like the ones I bought last year at my local sporting goods store.I am a size 7, and they fit like they should. I wear them to work as a nurse, and would wear them daily doing everything from yardwork to working out to amusment parks. They don't rub my skin when my socks are too low, and they dont hurt my feet. Now, they don't have thick pads of comfort, or a thick pad to walk on like some other brands, but I didnt want that. I would not recommend using these shoes to run or jog for exercise because they arent supportive enough for that. These are lightweight, and do not look bulky so that I can wear them with leggings and shorts without feeling like I have heavy looking shoes on.They are better than mesh because they feel like sock material over your feet. I love that because I dont like to have sweaty feet when I wear my shoes all day.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 October 2021
"adidas Women's Edge Lux 3 Running Shoe, Grey/Cloud White, 10 UK",Best sneaker I have ever owned.,"This is now my 8th pair of these as I have most of the colors.  Why so many- because it is the most comfortable sneaker on earth and versatile enough for working out, running errands and even wearing to work- hence why so many colors.I have arthritis in both knees, Achilles tendinitis in both feet, and am a life long flat footed person- I put on these sneakers and I feel like my feet are on air.  I over pronate  when I walk, which worsens my knee pain, but in these, my foot is well supported allowing me to walk briskly, without pain.This rose gold color is now my favorite color!",Reviewed in the United States on 2 February 2020

CLARKS Men's Un Ramble Step Black Leather 15 EE US,Very comfy and casual dress shoes that just does it,"It appears that Clark's went on an acquisition spree a few years ago and purchased 'unstructured', bostonian' and other brands. I had unstructured Sheridan when it was a stand alone company and it was the best and most comfortable dress shoes ever about 7 years ago. Looked like Clark's adopted all their 'comfortable' shoes under the unstructured brand. Sometimes, other brands like bostonian are sold under the unstructured brand which is misleading. I've spent so much money trying to buy the most comfortable shoes that look good and end up being a 50/50.Coming back to these shoes, I'm blown away by how comfortable they are and dressy. I have a function to attend with the wife and she wants the shoes to be dressy and looks very good and sharp. Very fortunately, it's comfortable as well so everyone wins. I'll be looking for open box deals on 12W as I found one for less than $50 which I jumped on.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 October 2019

I love these Clark's because they are lightweight and have the perfect amount of cushioned support. The first time I wore them I didn't like them, because the toe box was tight and rubbed a blister on the top of my foot. I stopped wearing them until my blister healed, and next time I put them on, wow, they were perfect. Once you get the leather stretched the shoe forms around your foot perfectly. The shoes do make a slight ""squishing"" sound as you walk, but you soon don't mind because it feels like you're walking on air. I love, love, love these shoes.",Reviewed in the United States on 20 November 2020

"CLEECLI Women's Ballroom Dance Shoes Latin Salsa Dancing Shoes Cross Strap 2.5inch 3inch Heel ZB04, Tan-2.5 Inch Heel, 8 UK",Finally Online Dance Shoes That Fit!,"Great news, sizing is as expected. Purchased normal U.S. dance shoe size. I wear size U.S. (woman's) 9 in street shoes and typically purchase 8 or 8.5 in dance shoes. Bought these in 8.5. For the most control when dancing, dance shoes are supposed to be just a tiny bit shorter than your foot-no overage. I bought them as an inexpensive practice shoe for the summer months. I dance at weekly outdoor salsa event and that dance suface is not the smooth hardwood one of a studio and can be brutal on shoes. I didnt want to ruin a new pair of $100+ dance shoes that way. Plus heat makes my feet swell, especially when I'm active which sizes me out of my winter practice shoes- remember what I said about sizing: should be no extra room in a well-fitting dance shoe. Interestingly I bought these after deciding to never purchase dance shoes on the internet again. The fit for dance shoes is so particular to your foot and the model shoe/brand you purchase, or at least thats been my experience. I've had only mediocre success with dance shoes I've purchased online. Sadly there are very few places locally where I can try on and purchase ballroom dance shoes. One is over 30 miles away, another has unpredictable hours and the owner rarely answers calls, or responds to VM. The studios where I dance have small collections, but not a lot of size variety so as much as I didn't want to purchase dance shoes online again, I was out of options. I was looking for a wide (stable), low heeled shoe that was very open in the front. I wanted enough material/straps to keep my foot stable, but little to rub on my foot and cause blisters. The peep-toe shoes with the small holes in the front have caused rubbing and blisters to my big toe in the past. My foot will always slide to the front of the (peep-toe) shoe and the place where it 'peeks' out of the hole in the front of the shoe, it rubs during dancing. These shoes do not rub or cause me blisters. They are stable and cushioned much more than I expected. They actually feel a bit plush and ' bouncy' because of the cushioning in the sole of the shoe, which I liked. The clasp is awesome because it allows you to choose the tightness of your strap and once you lock that in with the buckle, you only have to slide the buckle piece in and out of the clasp making getting in and out of the shoe quick and easy. One of the earlier reviewers of this shoe wasn't aware that design is intentional and thought her shoe was broken.The fastening straps of the shoe can be cut if they are too long. I haven't cut mine, but I did punch some additional holes in the straps so they would be tight enough on the top of my foot. All this is normal when dialing in your personal fit in a dance shoe. I'm very happy to say they've suited the purpose I bought them for and are holding up well in the month or so I've been using them. I haven't gotten blisters with these shoes rubbing my foot in the wrong way. Yay! Best internet dance shoe purchase to-date. I can finally lay-off using the leukatape I'd started wrapping my feet/toes with in my other dance shoes. Long nights of social dancing usually meant blisters. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this relatively inexpensive shoe. It is inexpensive, but not cheap. Also, they may not be show-stoppers, but they are pretty enough, and most importantly, comfortable practice shoes, which means I can dance longer and happier! The mesh is holding up well too. Oh, they also came with an inexpensive dust bag-perfect for carrying to practice or to socials. If it helps, my foot is: average width, flat, narrow heel. If you will be using this for ballroom dance and have a very narrow foot, I think this shoe may be too wide for you. Average to slightly wider feet (across the the forefoot) will likely fit this shoe best.",Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2018

I wear a 7 and that’s what I ordered. Had straps adjusted at my local shoe repair shop and these shoes fit like a charm.

"CLEECLI Women's Ballroom Dance Shoes Latin Salsa Dancing Shoes Cross Strap 2.5inch 3inch Heel ZB04, Tan-2.5 Inch Heel, 8 UK",Decently comfortable,"I ordered these shoes after trying out 3"" ""pimp/disco"" style platforms. The big issues with platform shoes were 1) they were made in every other size, and my size apparently falls right in between, and 2) they are very heavy.The primary reason to get these shoes was to get extra height as one of my dance partners is same height as me barefoot, and she wears heels. I also wear these shoes to practice different posture for balance and to just mess around.Comfort: these are decently comfortable. I don't mind wearing them but I find them less comfortable once I stop dancing and start standing around. My impression is I need a wider toe box compared to what some shoes offer and these seem to be fine in this regard.For reference, i usually wear men's size 10 and these shoes in size 12 fit me well.I do find that it is more difficult to lead in these shoes compared to standard men's ballroom dance shoes, in part because the leader must absorb the follower's energy and this is easier with wider soles, and because leader's spins are often quicker than follower's spins/turns which again demands better balance from the leader.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 April 2019
"CLEECLI Women's Ballroom Dance Shoes Latin Salsa Dancing Shoes Cross Strap 2.5inch 3inch Heel ZB04, Tan-2.5 Inch Heel, 8 UK",Good looking and comfortable! Only minor flaws.,"This shoe was really great! It fit perfectly and I love the strap that keeps my narrow heel in the shoe compared to others. They look really good on my feet. They blistered my two end toes, but for a cheaper shoe they are comfortable, so I put moleskin on the outer edge where it rubbed and that helped. My right foot is significantly bigger than my left and both shoes fit suitably.  In heels I’m almost a whole size smaller so I ordered a 9 1/2 which is perfect. The only thing that’s off is the plastic heel layer is very slippery on the dance floor and it makes it hard to put full weight on one foot when dancing. I’ve ordered heel grips, hoping they do the trick. Hope this helps!",Reviewed in the United States on 19 October 2018
"CLEECLI Women's Ballroom Dance Shoes Latin Salsa Dancing Shoes Cross Strap 2.5inch 3inch Heel ZB04, Tan-2.5 Inch Heel, 8 UK",Sizing chart is off--these are way too small,"I got these shoes for my daughter in middle school who is taking a social dance class. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them because it's only a one-semester class, and she is not going to need them after that. These seemed like a good deal, so I carefully measured her feet and used the sizing chart to order a size 6.5--even though she wears between a size 8-9  street shoe. Her feet are a little on the wide side, but not wide enough that she can't wear 'regular' (non-wide width or 'B' width) shoes. When these shoes came, they were size 7 (not the 6.5 I ordered), but it didn't even matter because the shoes were several sizes too small. She could cram her feet into them after several minutes of struggling, but it was easy to see that the straps dug into her skin and her toes were off the edge. I sent them back. I wanted to order a size 8, but the style she had to have for her class (brown color and 2.5-inch heel) was not available (sold out/backordered). I didn't have time to order something else from Amazon (even with 2-day shipping) and wait for it to be delivered, so I ended up going to a local dance store and spending A LOT more money on something that she could try on that was approved for her class. She also needed heel guards, which were easy to find at the local store, but almost impossible to try to determine the right size and shape for this dance shoe on Amazon. Anyone who sells dance shoes should also sell heel guards to fit them. I would have loved to have gotten these in a size 8--I think they would have worked and been a good shoe for what we needed at a good price.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2021

The actual product seems good, but cannot comment on its performance since they will need to be returned due to sizing. My husband typically wears size 9-9.5US and after reading some of the reviews suggesting to get 1-2 full sizes down, bought a size 8. This ended up being a touch too small as his toes touch the ends of the shoes. To be fair, this would be big for a size 8, but going down 1-1.5 sizes seems too small. From his experience, these shoes seem true to size or just a bit big. He would suggest to go with your regular size, or to size down 0.5 if you're in between sizes.

I used the shoes for probably a month, while I really like them, I couldn't give a 5 stars rating as I feel they missed the waterproof part of the product. sometimes,  I am getting some water from the leather, even when it's not heavy rain. other than this, I ordered the usual size I am ordering from any other brand and they fit as expected",Reviewed in Canada on 24 November 2019

"hummel Unisex Adults’ Reese Breaker Seamless Sneaker, Black/Sugar Coral, 5 UK","Die bequemsten Schuhe, die ich jemals getragen habe!","Auf der Suche nach bequemen Sneakern, sind mir diese von ""Hummel"" in die Augen gesprungen. Bezüglich der Optik sind Geschmäcker bekanntlich verschieden, ich persönlich finde sie aber sehr schön und stylisch.Schuhe im Internet zu bestellen ist immer so eine Sache für sich. Oftmals passen sie nicht richtig oder irgendwie drückt es. Deshalb war ich anfangs auch skeptisch - bis ich sie das erste Mal getragen habe. Ich bin perfekt in die Schuhe hineingerutscht, sie haben perfekt gepasst, waren extrem bequem und ich habe mich direkt darin wohl gefühlt. So bequeme Schuhe habe ich wirklich vorher noch nie getragen.Ein großer Nachteil an den Schuhen ist natürlich, dass sie sehr schnell dreckig werden, wenn man nicht aufpasst aber darauf lässt man sich ein, wenn man weiße Stoffschuhe kauft. Daher kann dies schlecht ein Kritikpunkt sein.Ich kann nur eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen!",Reviewed in Germany on 14 November 2021

Auf den ersten Online-Blick hat die Qualität für den angebotenen Preis gepasst, aber auf der ersten Wanderung, wo es uns eingeregnet hat und der Sohnemann zuhause die Schuhe ausgezogen hat, waren sie voll von rosarotem Pappmaché. Als wir die Sohle zum Trocknen herausgenommen haben mussten wir feststellen, dass in den Spritzgusssohlen die quaderförmigen Zwischenräume mit Pappmaché gefüllt waren, welches sich bei der eingedrungenen Nässe aufgelöst hatte und sich im ganzen Schuh verteilt hatte. Keine Dämpfung, kein Fußbett - nichts außer nassem Pappmaché.

Wir haben die Schuhe jeden Tag für den Kindergarten / die Vorschule an und nach 4 Wochen lösen sie sich nun leider auf. Sie lassen sich recht gut reinigen, so dass sie auch nach einem Tag im Sandkasten wieder passabel aussehen.Ganz dumm aber finde ich die Sohle! Die Innensohle aus Stoff kann man raus nehmen, sie ist sehr dünn und lapprig. Drunter befindet sich eine Sohle aus Pappe (!!!). Die ist fest im Schuh. Mein Sohn schwitzt an den Füßen (in diesen Schuhen umso mehr, denn atmungsaktiv sind sie beileibe nicht) und die Pappe wellt sich nun im Schuh.Daher kann das Laufen in den Schuhen nicht bequem sein.

Wir wandern viel und gerne. Das war uncharakteristisch.Bei unserer großen Pause am Mittag, nahm ich die Einlegsohle heraus, damit die vollgeschwitzten Schuhe besser trocknen, und fand sofort die Ursache für die Schmerzen. Die Schuhe sind offensichtlich mit Pappe ausgepolstert. Diese hat sich im Laufe der Wanderung so komprimiert, dass die im Bild sichtbaren Rillen durchgedrückt sind. Dass das beim Laufen wehtut ist klar!Ich hoffe bei der Erstattung klappt alles. Das geht nämlich gar nicht. Als Wander-, oder wie beschrieben gar Trekking-Schuh, völlig unbrauchbar.

Noch dazu kommt, dass vom Fuß ausgehende Feuchtigkeit (was Füße nunmal mitunter so an sich haben), sammelt sich hervorragend zwischen den beiden Sohlen.

Dieser Schuh hat die Bezeichnung TREKKINGSCHUH in keinster Weise verdient und nichtmal 8,-€ Schuhe aus bekannten Discountern haben so eine unterirdisch schlechte Qualität wie dieser Schuh.

Black Diamond Mens Zone Climbing Shoes,Fällt deutlich kleiner aus aufpassen!,Bestimmt ein Super Schuh leider fällt er ziemlich klein aus nur eine halbe Nummer kleiner als in Straßenschuhen bestellt und deutlich zu Klein so dass ein Hinein kommen Unmöglich war.,Reviewed in Germany on 27 October 2019
Black Diamond Mens Zone Climbing Shoes,Great Entry Level to Intermediate Bouldering Shoe,"Details:Black Diamond did a great job on the build of this shoe and it shows. The attention to detail is excellent. Good mid range shoe. More on the aggresive side but not extreme. Although the way that the shoes molded sole was built makes it an even range shoe. So it does well on overhangs and small foot chips when needed. The sole has a little flex or it can maintain the drop as well.Sizing:Black Diamond typically makes their shoes so you can order them in street shoe sizes. Although there are thousands of different feet variations so choose wisely. As for me, I have a wider foot base, more natural volume to my foot structure and proportionate toe size. So my street shoe size 10.5 is slightly too tight. I originally tried a 10 but that was way to small for my feet. Even considering a little stretch in time there's no way those would fit me. 10.5 was a squeeze for sure a little painful but bearable but I want to climb longer overhang routes so I opted for an 11 so I can wear them longer during sessions. These won't stretch too much because they are synthetic. Also I live in California and when you climb outside in the heat you're feet naturally swell up a bit from the weather and or the approach so they are perfect! That's my two cents. Happy climbing!",Reviewed in the United States on 4 February 2020

"adidas Originals Women's Tubular Viral W Running Shoe, Ice Purple Ice Purple/White, 9.5",Horrible quality and return policy!,"I am very upset with this company. I had to spend $15 to ship my return back to them and I also find out I'm going to be charged a 15% restock fee? For the price of the shoes I didn't expect to have to pay return shipping at all. By the time I am through I will have spent almost half the cost of the shoes just to send them back, I have never had a company double charge me like this to even think about reading the return policy. Obviously I will in the future but I think it's wrong for this company to have such a high restock fee and charge for return shipping for a product that cost $75. This is ridiculous, am very very upset about this and will NEVER order from them again!! The shoe is terrible quality and the material is harsh and uncomfortable.

Only downside for me was the fit. It fit perfectly in length, but in fit in the actual shoe was not very impressed. I have a pretty narrow foot so one of the shoe's elastic fit perfectly the other shoe's elastic was very big on me. Not quite sure the reason, but I still really loved the shoe. Another thing (which I really didn't mind, but others might) was the sole and bottom of the shoe is NOT flexible at all really. It is very hard and makes a noise when ever I walk. I do not mind this at all, but others might especially when buying a 100 dollar shoe. It got to my house fairly quickly and I was pleased when it arrived. Over all I really enjoy this shoe.

En primer lugar hablaremos de este calzado como el típico modelo genérico, con suela de goma apta para todo tipo de terrenos. Bien cosida a la horma, ésta se caracteriza por ser de material sintético consistente, lo que no le resta comodidad. La bamba en sí se ve muy cómoda y así me lo ha hecho saber mi hijo al probársela.Viene con unas plantillas interesantes que se extraen con facilidad si llevas plantillas de podólogo, como es el caso, o quieres alargarles la vida un poquito más cuando le crezca el pie a tu hipoteca andante.En el tema de la estética es donde personalmente encuentro mis mayores reticencias, pero el precio es tan ajustado, que para un niño que todavía no es ni preadolescente, nos podemos permitir ese lujo asiático de no volvernos locos con lo molón. Así que, mi hijo tan contento con sus ""bambas para destrozar en el cole"". Que oye, tampoco son tan feas y el negro pega con todo. Además son Puma, una marca de reconocido prestigio.

DR. Comfort Winner-X Men's Therapeutic Diabetic Extra Depth Shoe: 10 X-Wide (XW/6E) White,Call the Doctor,"I deal with a lot of swelling in my feet, and neuropathic pain as well. This is my second pair of Dr. Comfort's and they have pluses and minuses over the previous pair.Pluses:Extra ""depth"" to the shoe - Most of the swelling I have is on the top of my feet, with a little less to the sides. Having this extra depth keeps my foot from feeling mooshed into the shoe, putting extra pressure on the swollen areas.Velco Straps/Tongue design - Someone actually did a little engineering here. Instead of a regular flapper of a tongue this shoe has no tongue but a separation to the side of the shoe that opens wide, allowing a lot easier access to get one's foot into the shoe without having to yank the things on over your feet. The straps make adjusting the amount of pressure to hold the foot in place highly adjustable.Minuses:Inserts - Although these come  with very high quality inserts, they aren't as comfortable as my original Dr. Comforts. Not as well padded and not as good arch support. It probably would never be noticeable though if I hadn't had the first pair to compare.Inner Padding - The insides of my originals were soft as lamb's wool. While these are fairly comfortable, they are the level of cooshiness I've come to expect.The minuses are relative though. Compared to other shoes on the market, if you suffer from issues with your feet, these are a heck of a lot kinder to your tootsies than any ""normal"" shoe you will find.

"Mizuno Women's Wave Creation WAVEKNIT 2 Road Running Shoe, Quiet Shadeblack, 3.5 UK",Disappointing new version of this shoe,"Ok so I’ve run in the wave creations for 13 years and this update is very disappointing. First off it’s much heavier than previous models, maybe that means more cushioning and can be used for longer runs idk.  I don’t feel it has the same arch support and it bothers my shins slightly.  The toe box is smaller and it feels like my toe bang up against the medial side of the shoe.  This could be the shoe just runs smaller and I need a bigger size? Either way my feet are extremely narrow so I usually never have a problem with a narrow toe box.  It does not have a tongue which I actually love. It slides on so easily and feels like it fits great but then I start running... I thought it would the same as my other Mizunos but I’m frustrated I may have to find myself a new running shoe.

Also, the material by my ankles rubbed.

I had seen similar reviews for other Mizuno shoes about sizing, but most reviews of this particular shoe said they fit true to size. I would disagree. This is the second pair of Mizuno‘s I have ordered on Amazon and will return because they’re just too small. Seems as if the sizing of Mizuno has shifted overall, regardless of the style. Order a half size up and my guess is you’ll be very happy!",Reviewed in the United States on 28 August 2021
"Mizuno Women's Wave Creation WAVEKNIT 2 Road Running Shoe, Quiet Shadeblack, 3.5 UK",Huge Mizuno fan but the fit on these is terrible!,"I’m a huge mizuno fan, they have been my choice in running shoe for 10+ years but these are super disappointing. I am a 7 1/2 in regular shoes but always order an 8 or 8 1/2 in mizuno since they tend to run small. Bought an 8 1/2 and they don’t fit at all. The heel padding pushes your foot so far forward your toe is crammed at the front of the toe box. The plastic pieces that the laces attach to are rigid so if you try to tighten the laces to keep your foot back they push into the sides of your foot giving you blisters. This is more than a size issue, it’s an overall fit issue. Unfortunately I missed the return window so have tried to make these work, but there is just no way. Very disappointed!",Reviewed in the United States on 24 August 2021
"Mizuno Women's Wave Creation WAVEKNIT 2 Road Running Shoe, Quiet Shadeblack, 3.5 UK",The Right Size is a Crapshoot,"I wear a 9 1/2 Mizuno. At least, I have for the last 10 years. I ordered the Creation Waveknit 2 in a size 9 1/2. They were too small. So, I sent them back and ordered a size 10. I thought it was just me—because how could it possibly be the shoe—and thought if I sucked it up, put on thicker socks, and changed up the lacing that they would work. Nope.  It looks like I’m wearing clown shoes.  Like, they really look that ridiculous. These things actually slip off. And because I tried to make it work like an abusive relationship, I can’t send them back.So if you’re looking for a pair of women’s Creation Waveknit 2 running shoes in a size 10, I have a friend who can cut you a deal.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 April 2021

I got her a pair of 8.5C - a guess on sizing - and they fit perfectly for about 6 months, until she outgrew them. We got her next pair locally, and they don't carry split sole for kids, so she has the traditional style.  Planning ahead, I picked up a 10.5C here for when she outgrows the current pair.

I have had a lot of foot pain and they are super comfortable for all day wear and for walking. However there is something weird with the sole construction...I have 3 pair and it happens with all of them...they actually make you slip if say you run across water on the side walk. They even do this indoors on some occasions/surfaces =(Literally have almost ended up on the ground a dozen times. I do love the show otherwise so I still wear them I am now just aware and careful on water or super smooth surfaces. They need more grip. Time to hunt for a different model I think.,Reviewed in the United States on 29 April 2020
"New Balance Women's 1365v1 Walking Shoe, Chambray/Winter Sky/Silver Metallic, 5.5 UK",Extremely misrepresented,"I purchased these sneakers after much research.  New Balance sells them as a fantastic walking shoe.  The reviews rated this model with 4 to 5 stars and lots of positive feedback.  My intention was to get something comfortable to wear on a future trip to Germany where we expected  to do a lot of walking. I thought I had finally found what I was looking for......but unfortunately, they are not even close to comfortable.  At first I thought that I had to ""break them in"" so I was patient and kept wearing them for a 2 mile walk about 5 times since I purchased them.  Conclusion is that I cannot possibility consider wearing them.  After about 1 mile, the balls of my feet ache and I can't wait to take them off",Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2020

The left shoe is a lot more comfortable.  I will have to put some type of additional padding on my right foot, if I continue wearing them.

I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit?

I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks, an Ollie and kickflip if I’m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them. My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all.

We tried about 10 different shoes from all the major companies like carters, adidas, nike, and convers. Even the ""wide"" shoes from other companies weren't wide enough. These are the only ones that fit him. The tongue opens up and has Velcro on both sides. These shoes really let you adjust to fit any size foot. When you open up the Velcro on both sides it makes sliding his foot into the shoe very easy. We were so impressed that I went ahead and got the next 2 sizes up just because I didn't want to have to go through all this again later when he got bigger.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 October 2020

This is the second time I’ve bought the shoes (kids grow so fast) and I’ll probably buy a third pair. They may be more expensive than some shoes but I’d say well worth it.

MEBIKE Women Cycling Shoes Lady Road Bike Shoes Women Bicycle Shoes Lady High-Way Bike Lock Shoes Lady Road Riding Shoes with Rotary Buckle grey Size: 4 UK,So far so good!,"Overall, great shoe! I can’t say now great they will be clipped in to my peloton (still waiting... delivery just got pushed back again) but I tried them on my cheaper bike that doesn’t use clip in pedals and they seem sturdy but breathable.I initially ordered a larger size since a lot of the other shoes I’ve tried tended to run narrow and small. These do not. I have wider feet and these are by far the most comfortable. They seem like they’re pretty sturdy and they’re easy to get on/off unlike other cycle shoes I have tried.Important to me is they fit my orthotics/inserts. I struggle with plantar fasciitis flare ups every now and then so I wear orthotics whenever I do any exercise, so if anyone was wondering, mine fit in this shoe just fine.No, they do not come with clips, so purchase those separately. Majority of cycle shoes don't come with clips btw.If anything happens with them, I’ll update but from my use so far, they fit my wide-ish feet, are comfortable, easy on/off, and I actually think the print is fun!",Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2021

I love and swear by my other merrel's but these are a total miss. Soles still look great and love the color and styling, just wish they would last longer.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 August 2017
"Merrell Men's Moab FST Waterproof Hiking Shoe, Brown, 7.5 D(M) UK","A good shoe, but it does get warm.","UPDATE: April 2019 (original review below):  By November 2018, I stopped wearing these shoes regularly because they were just too hot to wear comfortably for long periods.  I cannot recommend these shoes because they just become too hot.  The heat results in excessive sweating and the shoes smell bad as a result.  Find another pair.  Reducing review to two stars.-----------Original review:I ordered these Merrell Men's Moab fST Waterproof Hiking Shoes to replace a set of Keen hiking shoes that I had worn out.  The Keens are excellent shoes and very comfortable, but they tend to get extensive wear on the soles (particularly for me, the heels wear out within 9 mos).  This review is my initial impression and I will update if anything changes.FIT:  The shoes fit as expected.  They seem a bit tighter than the Keen equivalent but are as expected for the size.COMFORT: These waterproof shoes get hot and are hotter than the Keen equivalent waterproof shoe.  The foot bed is definitely not as good as the Keen, probably the most notable difference.WATERPROOF: So far, so good.  I had to wade into shallow water and my feet were dry until the water got deep enough to overtop the shoe.OVERALL QUALITY: I have high hopes that the heel on this shoe will not wear as quickly.  Quality of the shoes seems very high.I rate these shoes as 4 stars out of 5, with the subtraction coming for the less comfortable foot bed than the competition and the lessened breathability resulting in more heat in the foot.  I can't help but feel that if the shoe had a breathable but waterproof fabric, the shoes would feel cooler and more comfortable for extended wear.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 March 2018
"Merrell Men's Moab FST Waterproof Hiking Shoe, Brown, 7.5 D(M) UK",Nice looking casual / athletic shoe,"I've been a Merrell wearer for around 10 years, now and have wanted to try their more casual line.  I typically buy Moabs or Chameleon Stretch Gore-Tex and expected these to feel a lot more flimsy.  While they are a little lighter, they still feel durable and look to be well made.  The laces are heavy-duty and a good length.  The Vibram soles feel a little softer than what the Moabs use, but I haven't noticed quick wear on them.  I haven't tested them for water resistance, at this point, but will update if I do.Pros:Lighter than the outdoor hiking shoes.Look sharp and athletic.Good gripping soles.Fits as expected.Comfortable for hiking and light running.Cons:The fit is a little less secure than the outdoor shoes, do to the lack of the ""heel lock"" lace hole.  I wish it was there, but since I wanted these for a casual shoe, it's not a deal-breaker.Arch is a little higher than I expected.  It could break in to where it needs to be after a while.Update:These just aren't breaking in to be comfortable and the loose fit around the ankle is becoming a problem.  I wear low / no-show socks and it rubs badly on the heel area.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2018
"Merrell Men's Moab FST Waterproof Hiking Shoe, Brown, 7.5 D(M) UK",Highly recommended. Waterproof!,"I've had these for about a year and only wear them when I go hiking or when it's raining. Up until the other day I wasn't even going to write a review because I wasn't especially impressed or dissatisfied. However, I just returned from a backpacking trip here in Florida and these shoes performed as well as I could ever have expected.

Da wir im letzten Winter sehr gute Erfahrungen mit Stiefeln von Jack Wolfskin gemacht haben, sind wir dabei geblieben und haben erneut bestellt.Die Schuhe wurden zügig im üblichen Schuhkarton, und in Folie verpackt, geliefert. Die Schuhe in einem dunklen Blau und mit heller Sohle inklusive weißem Streifen gefallen uns und unserem Sohn sehr gut. Gerade den Pfotenabdruck bringt er schnell in Verbindung mit einer seiner Lieblingssendungen („Paw Patrol“).Die Schuhe sind tadellos verarbeitet, alle Nähte und Klebestellen sind akkurat ausgeführt. Die Sohle ist schon dick und mit grober Struktur. Das sorgt für eine gute Isolierung und besten Grip. Der Klettverschluss erlaubt es unserem Sohn die Schuhe allein an- und auszuziehen. Die Schuhe sind schön dick gefüttert, ganz oben zudem mit Kunstfell verziert.Wir sind uns sicher, dass auch dieses Paar schön warm und wasserdicht ist – ohne die Füße zu sehr ins Schwitzen zu bringen. Der Hersteller wirbt nicht umsonst mit 100% Wetterschutz dank Texapore (wasserdicht bis 10.000mm Wassersäule und atmungsaktiv > 3.400g/m²/24h).

"Dunham Men's Captain Boat Shoe, Blue Multi, 11.5 X-Wide",Can't replace laces because they sewed them into the shoe... Ridiculous,They sewed the damn shoe laces into the back of the shoe. Now in order to switch to the type of laces I prefer I have to cut the original laces so that I can put the ones I like in. I'll wait for a bit before I do that but this is not starting off well.What even worse is they didn't even make the laces even before sewing the lace into the back end of the shoe so on one foot the lace is a solid 6 inch longer on one side. I can get past this for a comfortable shoe but it's a severe annoyance that when I do replace the laces that I cannot run them the way they were intended to go...Stupid move on the manufacturers part. They got 2 stars so far because they fit like they are supposed to but still really annoyed about the laces being sown in....,Reviewed in the United States on 20 November 2019
"Dunham Men's Captain Boat Shoe, Blue Multi, 11.5 X-Wide","Comfortable shoe, but with serious problems","I've had these shoes before and I loved the comfort and fit, but this model has some serious problems.  Firstly, the shoe has a serious design flaw.  The laces are sewn in place and not replaceable!  The laces wrap all the way around the heel, as a real moccasin would, but they are sewn in at the heel.  If your lace wears out, as mine did, the shoe is worthless.  The first time this happened, New Balance was kind enough to replace the shoe.  The second time, the shoe was  pretty well worn out, so I just bought a new pair.  That's when I discovered the second problem.  After only wearing the shoe a week (a week!) the leather ripped out along the stitching near the base of the tongue on the left shoe.  OK, no problem, I returned the shoe to Amazon and got another pair.  The 2nd pair popped a stitch at the same place on the right shoe BEFORE I GOT THE SHOE ON MY FOOT!!  Just opening up the shoe caused a tear.  Now I have to return the second pair too, this time for a refund.It looks like NB is having some manufacturing problems, (you can see how some stitching is off a tiny fraction, actually weakening the leather by crossing the pre-punched holes where pieces are stitched together) so as much as I liked this shoe when I first bought it several years ago, I won't be buying it again anytime shoe.",Reviewed in the United States on 14 May 2015
"Dunham Men's Captain Boat Shoe, Blue Multi, 11.5 X-Wide",Very good boat shoes,"These Dunham Captain boat shoes retail for $120 and I paid less than $40 here on Amazon.  So, that's good.  The shoes are actually very good quality with excellent functionality.  The fit is as expected and it wears like a comfortable tennis shoe.  The sole is non-slip rubber and it grips great.  I spent 7 days on my boat in wet conditions right after buying these shoes and they preformed like a champ.  The leather is water-proof.  The shoe will not get water-logged.  The nylon vents (light brown areas) allowed for water drainage (I did walk in the water a few times just to see how they functioned).  There's also what New Balance calls a ""rollbar"" in the heal.  Basically, it provides stability to prevent your ankle from rolling right or left.. oddly, I found this feature very beneficial.  When you're walking on a slipper surface, your ankles can do funny thing.  This rollbar functions from below your heel... it's not like an ankle brace, but it works great.  So the design and functionality is excellent.  I'm not sure about the quality since I've only owned them for about a month. They're made in China.  If New Balance made them in the USA (like the 990s), I would've given these shoes 5 stars.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2015
"Dunham Men's Captain Boat Shoe, Blue Multi, 11.5 X-Wide",Perfect Fit; Amazing Quality and Comfort,"What an awesome, high-quality, comfortable shoe. I can't say I've been able to say that for the past decade or so -- it seems most shoes are only built to last about three months before they fall apart.I have enormous feet and - as I'm sure anyone reading this for that very reason understands - it is difficult to find stylish, comfortable shoes for everyday wear.If you have a large, wide food -- look no further. This shoe not only fit me perfectly out of the box, it was nearly 100% perfectly comfortable with minimal break-in (just under a week with minimal wear), and looks great to boot. The soles are thick enough to offer great support, but not thick and awkward enough that they look like clunky orthopedic clown shoes.This shoe looks great with slacks and would fit in a dressy or casual environment. I'll be picking up a spare set out of fear that they stop making them.PROS:•Great Fit for Wide Feet (4E)•Quality Construction•Comfortable for All-Day Wear / Walking•Doesn't Look Like a Boat on Your Foot (round-toe shoes in large sizes tend to look comical)CONS:•Stiff Heel for the First Week (I taped my heels under my socks to minimize blisters; heel seems to have broken in within 4 days)•Toe is Rounded (I prefer squared toes for style reasons, but this still looks nice)",Reviewed in the United States on 14 September 2017
"Dunham Men's Captain Boat Shoe, Blue Multi, 11.5 X-Wide","Stylish, super comfortable and surprisingly rugged triple-E all-round shoes","Stylish, super comfortable and surprisingly rugged, I wore these on a seven day whitewater rafting trip through the Grand Canyon (280 miles, 180 rapids, including the dreaded 'Lava Falls"" rapids) - then wore them 'most everywhere in North-central Arizona.Was surprised at how well they drained and dried - and remained pliable.They 'spiffed up' right back to nearly new with just a little cleaning and a couple of coats of polish.I'm a triple-E or even quad-E width. These fit perfectly, so for those with w i d e  feet, these are a real find.  Still very comfortable.

"Dunham Men's Captain Boat Shoe, Blue Multi, 11.5 X-Wide",Perfect for large and wide feet.,"I have issues with my big feet, so I took a chance with these. Happy I did, big enough for my sasquatch feet, and wide enough as well. Comfy too. Not a lot of arch support, but I have worn worse. One down side was trying to replace the laces with elastic ones. The lace runs around the side and back of the shoe, trying to pull them out did not work well. Tying laces is an issue for me, but that is an issue for me, even so, I did knock off a star. Be aware, and hope the laces last as long as the shoes. Or you may have to get creative to replace a broken lace.",Reviewed in the United States on 14 March 2020

"adidas Men's Adipower Weightlifting Ii Cross Trainer, Collegiate Royal/Black/Collegiate Royal, 15 UK",They get the job done.,"It's a weightlifting shoe. I Originally bought the adistar 2008s over 10 years ago and I'm trying to use different shoes when I'm not aggressively lifting since they are triple or more the price from when I got them and I want them to last. The Adipower is ok by comparison. The toe bot accommodates my wide feet and I'm able to reasonably tighten them so my foot feels secure. I trust them more than the shoes with the weird tightening mechanism. You may not fall in love with them, but they aren't that expensive and have a non compressible heel. I think some other people talked about doing things other than lifting. They have little in the way of padding, which is good. I wouldnt suggest doing cardio or walking in them (I get sore from the foot up if i walk too long in lifting shoes). You can bend your foot enough for the split jerk if you Olympic Lift. It does well for squats and is good for push press, wall balls, etc",Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2020

ASICS Gel-Kayano 5 360 Men&#39;s Running Shoes,Great comfy pair of tennis!,"I gave these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because of the insoles.  I have sensitive feet, am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day, and have a bad back so I’m critical about my footwear and often purchase premium insoles for my most worn shoes, boots, and even my house slippers.  The shoes themselves are excellent - ASICS gel never disappoints!  These have a very breathable construction to prevent foot sweating (and future stink) that some shoes may not provide.  My feet sweat more than the average joe so I consider breathable construction critical as well.  I love the color choices and the one I chose looks great with a pair of jeans and  a t-shirt and are not a total eye catcher.  Some women with a big bust may be able to relate to this similarity.  Sure, it’s great to show off and look good, but I like a fairly modest look.  If you are looking for a great brand of tennis shoes that are durable, lasting, colorful, comfortable, and cozy, consider ASICS gel brand shoes.  For those of you with lower back pain who visit chiropractors whom do mention finding a comfortable pair of footwear and insoles, I have not tried much but the Dr. School’s branded insoles.  They have several types and the packaging is designed where a buyer can squeeze the insoles anf feel the material they are made of.  Anyway, these shoes are not the first pair of ASICS gel shoes I have owned over the years and they do not disappoint.  If I had a kid, I would bring him or her up in ASICS for sure- and perhaps some cute looking gorilla slippers or maybe even some of those shoes that resemble lizard feet and “growl” when the kids stomp their feet.  I also like Nike Air, Sketchers, and k-Swiss “tubbers”.  They are also kind to a middle-aged man wit s bit of back pain.  Lift with your knees, wear comfortable shoes, stretch a couple minutes in bed when you first wake up, don’t sit on a huge wallet that makes you bum uncomfortable, take it easy, and visit a chiropractor twice within a week when back problems become an issue and you’ll be happy.  It wouldn’t hurt getting a massage either from time to time either.  Oh, and be critical on the chairs you sit on often and adjust your automobile lumbar support properly too.  You can do a lot of little things on your own like that and they even sell automobile seat mats that massage your butt and back too.  But yeah, a good pair of shoes is top on the list and ASICS gel does not disappoint!",Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2021
ASICS Gel-Kayano 5 360 Men&#39;s Running Shoes,Great shoes overall,"I love Asics and have been wearing them for like 20+ years. I'm a huge fan of the Kayano series. So when I saw these, I was very intrigued. I wear them for the gym and they're great for it—I wouldn't recommend running for long distances in them like regular Kayanos—because they're a lot stiffer.Only reason why I gave it four stars is because the sole/tread seems to be made of a different, slicker material. So when you walk outside on wet surfaces, it's much more slippery than any other Asics I've had—much less other regular Kayanos.Otherwise, it's a great shoe for the gym because of the tread pattern under the arch. Love the design and looks of it too.",Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2020
ASICS Gel-Kayano 5 360 Men&#39;s Running Shoes,Inner material is causing blisters,"I bought these as my regular running shoes. I usually wear size 11.5 but upon trying these decided that the extra room might be causing extra movement leading to a burning sensation and ultimately, blisters on my little toes. I then exchanged them for size 11 which feel snug and good initially. The padding is thick and feels very cushioned on walking or running. However, after about 45 mins and 5 miles of running, my feet like they are on fire. My little toes have been getting painful blisters. I think the inner material is causing a lot of friction and heat buildup. I tried giving them a chance and had them for a month or so but I am going to go back to my older climacool Adidas that have perforated soles and have never given me any problems.",Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2020

But I'd get these again as long as they're not $80 or above (can't ever justify $80 shoes in my head, even if they are amazing). And if they were under $70 I'd get them every time. Wouldn't even bother looking at other shoes.",Reviewed in the United States on 11 December 2021

adidas Kids' Adissage,Fakes?,"We own 4 pairs of Adissage slides in our family. After one of the kids lost hers, she's been begging about a replacement. These seem different than the other pairs we own. The logo on the heel is different -see  the Adidas website for comparison. They are much lighter. The the nubs  on the footbed are shorter and more blunt. The annoying part is the top band is pushed too far back from the toe, which makes your toes really stick out.  We are keeping these, but next time will stick to the originals as the fit appears more comfortable.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 April 2019
adidas Kids' Adissage,Adidas has changed their quality drastically,"I wish I had read others reviews before buying, but since my son already owned and loved a pair, I didn’t even think twice before sizing up. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME as they used to be made. See my pics of old vs new. In fact, when I opened them up, I thought I got cheap €hin@ knockoffs. They are so thin, the sole feels like a dollar store shoe quality, and the nubs are duller. Also, these seem much wider than the originals. Adidas has done their customers wrong by changing the quality!!! My son won’t let me return them because he loves his other pair so much he wants them again, but I have a feeling the quality will not outlive his shoe size this time and we’ll definitely be buying a different brand next time.",Reviewed in the United States on 25 August 2020

"ECCO Men's Jamestown Hydromax Chukka Boot, Coffee Nubuck, 9/9.5 UK",Expectations Well and Truly Exceeded,"I am a bit over 50yo and I have probably owned a grand total of five or six pairs of boots during my life. This is a very small number of boots given I grew up where we consistently had snow cover during the winter. I have worn each pair of those boots, maybe, a maximum of three or four times each before chucking them out even though they were all 'good quality' boots and in excellent shape. I found that the slip-on boots quickly became loose, the ones with many eyelets took me forever to put on and take off and the ones with only a few eyelets never really felt they were on quite right. I can also say they were all uniformly pretty uncomfortable, particularly when you consider I would rather have cold, wet, feet in freezing temperatures then wear those boots. That really should tell you something. Anyway a few years back I moved to a place in country Victoria, Australia. Although it is not quite as wet and as cold as where I grew up, I do often end up traipsing through sodden fields and forests. Early onset senility must have begun to set in, because, after having wasted so much money boots in the past, I thought it would be a good idea to waste some more money on a new pair I would hate. After spending what seemed like a week on the internet looking at boots 24/7, I finally settled on a pair of ECCO Jamestown Hydromax Chukka's. Simply put, they are unbelievably comfortable, such that they have only come off when I have showered or slept. This is despite having more than half-a-dozen more appropriate and expensive pairs of shoes/slippers for whatever it was I was doing at the time for which boots really the footwear for the job. I really can not recommend these boots highly enough.",Reviewed in Australia on 29 August 2021

"adidas Men's Sprintstar m Running Shoe, Black/White/Signal Coral, 10 UK",Not bad but not great,These are good if you're looking for an entry-level Sprint Spike. Reason I only give it three stars though is because the strike plate is not solid across the bottom. It is rubber and can bend through the arch and heel. This makes it good for a 400m but not for a 100 and 200 meter race. In a 100 and 200m race having a solid strike plate through the heel Forces you to stay on your toes. It is a lot harder to stay on your toes all the way through 400 race. So the flexion in this strike plate being made of soft rubber allows the heel to flex and touch the ground. But I needed a shoe for a shorter Sprint that has a solid strike plate all the way through to the heel.,Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2020

"Columbia Men's Granite Ridge Waterproof Wide Hiking Shoe, Dark Grey, Golden Yellow, 9 UK",Good but perhaps overly sensible.,"These are, as I like to think, the shoes that DeWalt would make if they made shoes. They feel like they are made to come with a drill. They were good in winter in London and not at all sweaty or too hot. They had good grip and stood up to puddles and walks in the city and the country. I personally put other inner soles inside but that’s my preference with most shoes. I did take them for a spin in California before I left to London and I will say that they felt a bit gammy under those conditions. They are not very breathable. However, if you are headed somewhere where it’s mostly miserable, you will be quite happy. Just don’t wear them on a date.",Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2020

Not sure what Puma has done as they seem to be slightly smaller than the last pair I bought.  I recommend buying a half size larger than your normal size.  Luckily, since they are made out of Kangaroo leather, they will stretch slightly, which is why I recommend a half size larger.

Sie sind relativ eng am Einstieg und passen meinem Sohn mit seinen schmalen Füßen gut. Er kann sie alleine anziehen und auch enger stellen.Gekauft habe ich sie Anfang April, durch Corona (Kiga geschlossen) hat er sie allerdings nicht oft getragen. Jetzt Anfang Juni haben die Schuhe an den Seiten Löcher im Obermaterial und sind leider auch nicht mehr dicht. Bei einer Preisempfehlung des Herstellers von 85€ ein Unding.

(Erst ab Größe 28 kommt der Schuh ohne Klett-band und mit einem Schnellverschluss System).Die Innensohle ist herausnehmbar und hat zudem einen gekennzeichneten Bereich wie weit die Zehen des Kinderfusses gehen sollten.Die Schuhe sind sehr leicht und angenehm zu tragen. Er eignet sich für leichte Wanderungen aber auch so als Outdoor- und Feitzeitschuh, gerade für Matsch- und Schneewetter, da er über den Knöchel geht und die Kinderfüße so gut geschützt sind.Mir war außerdem wichtig, dass die Schuhe eine Gore Tex Membrane haben und somit wasserdicht sind!Ich habe das gleiche Modell auch noch als ""low cut"" Variante bestellt, diese ist noch etwas leichter und Alltagstauglicher!Fazit: Toller Schuh, den man aber gerade für längere Wanderungen eher eine Nummer Größer bestellen sollte!",Reviewed in Germany on 25 February 2020

"ASICS MATCONTROL Wrestling Shoes, Black/Black, Size 13",Love these,"These appear to essentially be the replacement for the Cael v8.0s, maybe with some minor improvements. I originally ordered the Cael v8.0s in a 10.5US and had to return them because they were too narrow. I ordered these in an 11US (a full size larger than normal for me) and they fit comfortably snug. I got them for martial arts and they will also be good for weight training. They grip great, but still allow twisting without catching on the mat. I like the mid-high top design as they keep my heel in place and add a bit of extra ankle support. The tongue is not too bulky either. Doesn't hurt that they also look totally cool.",Reviewed in the United States on 4 March 2019
"ASICS MATCONTROL Wrestling Shoes, Black/Black, Size 13",Don't Fret Much About Fit,"First of all I bought these shoes to wear while lifting weights, so I have no idea how well they perform on the mat, but they look and feel great. They put your feet flat on the floor as if you were barefoot while giving ankle support; similar feel to Converse, except they contour to your feet and are more lightweight. However the soles will put you at a slight deficit, so keep that in mind if you plan on deadlifting.Personally I wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, Reebok and Nike. Occasionally I have to size down, like with Doc Martens (size 9-10) and Converse (9.5). I was skeptical of purchasing these online after reading negative reviews about the fit, so I went half a size up to be safe. After trying them on, I think they're overblown. I'm happy with the 11s, but I honestly think I could've broke in my usual size, since they're pretty malleable. Unless you have wider feet I wouldn't worry about the fit.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 June 2021
"ASICS MATCONTROL Wrestling Shoes, Black/Black, Size 13",Buy a half size up and you've got yourself a pair of good boxing shoes,"This is my first pair of boxing shoes so I was very worried about the fit according to the many reviews I read about on the sizing. Most of them recommended getting a full size up, but I went with my gut feeling and just got a half size up. I usually wear a size 9 1/2 for most regular shoes, so I went with a size 10 for this boxing shoe. Fit was perfect. Of course, boxing shoes will always have that snug/tight feel, but the pair I got had just the right amount of tightness. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase! I will buy this again in the future when the one I have wears out.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2019

"Bloch Women's Broadway Hi Dance Shoe, Tan, 8.5 UK",Beautiful look,They are made really well and are very pretty.  I received the shoes on time and I tried them on but they were a bit small.  I think I have to break them in and then they might fit a little better.  They do come with an insole so if they are a little big I think that would help them fit better. I have small feet. size 4 1/2.  I would have given them a 5 star rating but they did fit snug.  I would have returned them but had already worn them out of the house.  If you are looking to purchase go a half size up.,Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2019
"Bloch Women's Broadway Hi Dance Shoe, Tan, 8.5 UK",Elegant look in a character shoe,"Looked at reviews and did buy them bigger than my size 7 street shoe size, I got size 8. Plenty of room without being too loose or looking big like clown shoes, and fits well in the heel. The strap has a good bit left since I have to use the closest hole but I found I can also fasten the buckle and leave it buckled and slide them on, which will be helpful if I have a quick change. The extra bit of strap isn’t bothering me at this point.I’ll definitely need an insert of some kind for the balls of my feet though, after a three hour rehearsal, my feet hurt. I love the height and overall look of these shoes, definitely give the extra glamor I was after. Just need them to feel better and they’ll be almost perfect.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2020

I ordered a size 5 narrow width thinking it would solve my problems. Nope! They were hilariously small. For reference, I own a pair of Sperry boat shoes in child size 2.5. I couldn't even get my foot into them and neither could a fellow dancer with even smaller feet than mine. Unfortunately with all of the Covid stuff, I didn't get to try them on until well after the return window had ended so the money I spent is lost.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 August 2020

There are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle.  Very POOR design !  Because of that I cannot comment on the fit or comfort.  I had high hopes for these.

"La Sportiva Solution White/Yellow Climbing Shoes, 6.5 UK",Big disappointment,"I chose these shoes because of how amazingly they fit my feet when I tried them in an offline store. Unfortunately they had no proper size, so I ended up ordering shoes online.The order came in time and in a good shape, but on my second visit to bouldering gym I noticed that one of the laces started to tear. I didn't pay enough attention to that and that was my big mistake. You can see on the pictures how the lace look like after just 5 bouldering sessions. It's almost totally ruined on the left shoe and started to tear on the right one.This is especially surprising as I do not tie shoes tightly (they're 3 sizes smaller).Obviously it's too late to return them now after 1.5 months and visible signs of usage (is it even possible to have no such signs on climbing shoes?)Later I found out that this issue is so common for La Sportiva Solutions that some shoe repairs even have a separate price for replacing laces on this particular model. Unfortunately there are no specialized shoe repairs nearby and sending shoes to anywhere else is too expensive, so now I end up with brand new shoes without laces.Summarizing: do not buy this model if you're not ready to replace  laces right after the purchase.",Reviewed in Germany on 5 October 2019

PUMA Unisex Kids&#39; Astro Kick Sneaker,4 year old approved!!,"I bought these for my 4 year old. He has a pair of other slip on sneakers that are similar and worn out! I ended up ordering these 1.5 sizes bigger than his other shoes, due to the other ones getting small, and from previous puma experience, they always seem to run small! I probably would have been better off only ordering a 1/2 size or 1 whole size bigger, because these shoes flap in the back when he walks! Because of this, I am unsure if these really do run small or are true to size! My 4 year old said they are very comfortable though, and they do have a nice thick cushion inside! The only thing I am not sure I like or not since he hasn't worn them out, is the tongue in the shoe. It doesn't pull up very far and I am not sure if it is going to bother him or not! I ended up getting these for a great price so all in all I think they were worth every penny, and I hope he gets some wear out of them soon!

Unfortunately, not only are they too long (I wear an 8 1/2 D and I ordered an 8), but they are also not a true wide.  The bottom of the shoe is not wide and does not fully support the foot.  The shoe does appear to be able to stretch so it would give more room in the toe box, but unfortunately my foot would hang over the side and not be supported by the bottom.  Sadly, I am returning them.",Reviewed in the United States on 16 August 2021

I purchase white with pink stripes, but the white looks more like a blue white. It seriously looks like the sneakers were put in the wash with a load of blue jeans and the color bled onto the sneakers. The pink stripes look a little cheesey. As if they can be peeled right off.

"La Sportiva Men's Jackal Trail Running Shoes, Black Yellow, 8 UK",Óptima zapatilla para correr en montaña,"Excepcional zapatilla para correr en montaña. Buenas prestaciones subiendo, aunque no para pruebas verticales, buen agarre sea en subida sea reteniendo. Suela de retorno excepcional y pisada súper confortable.Upper fantástico y suficientemente ancho para entrenamiento o Carrera largos (más de cuatro horas). Mediopié y talón no tan estrechos como me gustaría, pero confortable y envolvente.Lengüeta tipo calcetín unido al upper, aunque fabuloso para evitar la entrada a la plantilla de piedras, arena y chinitas, pero tras muchas horas se acumulan en el fondo de la propia lengüeta que hace de “saco”.Los cordones serpentean por los ojales cosidos en los paneles laterales del upper. Esto unido a la elasticidad de los cordones ayuda mucho a relajar posibles estrecheces cuando el pie se “calienta” (ensancha).  El Mesh (laterales) evacuan bastante bien el calor de la zapatilla, pensé que con calor iban a ser un horno, pero no, airean correctamente, aunque para verano mejor mesh de verano en lugar de este (ideal primavera/otoño y días en que no superes los 30 grados y necesites gore). favorece la ventilación y el confort térmico. Suela muy amortiguada..., desconozco materiales.Suela Frixion Red.Drop de 7.Óptimo balance todo terreno, aunque mi uso será sencillamente correr cómodo, ni compito ni las llevo para caminar, son perfectas para lo que las compré, correr cómodo más de 3 horas sin problema. Para mí, Ideales para correr en pista o senda compacta de llana a desniveles medios, pero eso irá en “gustos” y sensaciones de cada corredor.Por el peso no me preocupo, en cuanto meto barro..., ya he ganado gramos, así que no me preocupa, pero son muy ligeras, aunque mi número, un 46 1/2 he cogido son más de 300 gramos.Calzo un 10 en zapato.

I always wear a 7.5 in tennis shoes but wear a 7 in these. They fit perfectly.  I love that these are slightly wider so they don't squeeze my feet too hard (like Nike's sometimes can). They can take a little bit of time to stretch out but fit amazingly once they do. I already have a pair of the all black Adidas Alphabounce & I love them so much I had to get a gray pair as well!  They're high quality & I've gotten lots of compliments on them. Pictures were taken after a month & a half of use & they still look brand new, they're awesome shoes!",Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2019
"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US",Probably fake,"I’m 90% sure these are fake. I have owned other Alphabounces before, and what I liked about them was the light, pillowy sole. The sole of these shoes are dense and heavy, like it’s made of recycled plastic or something. The fit is terrible, very wide and loose on my feet (and I have wide feet!). All together they just don’t look or feel legit. I will be returning them right away",Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2019
"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US",Questionable Authenticity,I read a lot of good reviews about this shoe on the adidas website and how comfortable and soft it is but was very disappointed when i tried them on. They are bulky and hard and the outsole is super wide making your feet look way bigger than they actually are. Because they're so hard it almost makes me question if these are authentic?,Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2018
"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US",Fraud! Not Adidas!,"These are not actually Adidas.

"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US",At first glance I loved the shoes,"At first glance I loved the shoes! Once I put them on and looked down at them, I didn't like them near as much. The soles are super wide. But they are very comfy and very light weight so I didn't return them. Now after a few weeks of having these shoes I'm glad I kept them--they've grown on me and love the way the feel.",Reviewed in the United States on 4 June 2018
"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US",Ehhhh,"I ordered a full size smaller like the reviews say- that was a mistake. It was very snug and hard to get on at first since the tounge is connected to the rest like a thick snug sock. I suggest ordering only a half size down. Also something weird- there’s good support on the heel but when you move from heel to toe (like running), the outer toes’ soul is thinner than the big toe and feel uneven, like stepping halfway on a crack.",Reviewed in the United States on 24 August 2018
"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US",Make my feet look huge!,"I ordered these a 1/2 size down as was recommended in the reviews, but they were still too big. I returned them for a whole size smaller and they fit better. The only thing I did not like was that they made my feet look huge. They are wide. I wear my workout shoes with yogas so these shoes made my feet look like I had elephant feet. I returned them and went with a pair of NB. These are a good deal, but if you are not a fan of fat shoes, these are not for you.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2019
"adidas Performance Women's Alphabounce Beyond w, Ecru Tint/Ash Pearl/Ash Pearl, 10 Medium US","I love these shoes, had to order another pair","Best shoes I’ve ever bought sight unseen and not tried on first. My shoe size is normally 10.5 wide but I ordered an 11 and they fit perfectly. I ordered another pair in grey. I have ongoing battles with shoes normally due to one foot having a fallen arch and pain in the heel, so it makes it hard to find comfortable shoes that will make both feet comfortable. I’ve never owned a pair of Adidas before so it’s nice that the shoes fit right out of the box and are comfortable,",Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2019

Brooks Anthem 3 Grey/Alloy/Blue 10,Great Shoe,Great shoe.  Nice update from the Anthem 2.  Perfect shoe for my 17 year old son who uses it as his everyday shoe as well as his running shoe.

Never had a problem with Brooks running shoes before, so I'm very disappointed.  They are still usable at the moment, but it's only a matter of time before I'll need a new pair and these get thrown out.*UPDATE* I was able to get in contact with Brooks & they sent me a newer version of these shoes, FREE OF CHARGE!

Brooks Anthem 3 Grey/Alloy/Blue 10,Not good for over pronation,"My son has worn the Brooks Ravenna for a few years due to extreme over pronation. We ventured out to try a new style, the Anthem.

"ASICS Kid's Jolt 2 PS Running Shoes, 2.5M, HOT Pink/White",Not good for outside! Slippery soles.,I will start by saying I love ASICS shoes and buy them exclusively as my workout shoes.This pair was a little less expensive. I thought I was getting a deal but they aren’t really on par with what I’ve had in the past. Not a lot of support for the foot in the front of the shoe and not a lot of tread/grip on the sole. Not good for running or walking in even slightly wet conditions as they slip very easily.

I wear a 13, i ordered a 14 like they recommend. I had to take them off while I was driving. There are 2 white lace type materials that squeeze your foot and causes the issue.I also had trouble putting them on even at a size bigger. I had to put them on, on the back of my truck to get enough leverage to get them on.I took the shoe from a 1 star to a 4 star. In my photos you'll notice the white lace eyelet. Remove the shoe string all the way, then cut the white lace. Its actually sewen to the inside of the shoe which is why it gets so friggin tight. Then feed your shoe string through one of the holes where the white lace was and lace them like normal shoes. They over thought this for too long. I have the JJ2s and theyre tight too. JJ3s arent as tight with what modification i mentioned above.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2020

Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Slip OX Fashion Sneaker Shoe - Thunder/Casino/Black - Little Kid - 12,then I do not recommend.,"My daughter absolutely loves Converse shoes and she loves the color of these slip on shoes EXCEPT her feet slip out of the shoes. They are the right size but they are also a bit heavy so her heels come up at every step. She can only wear them with really thick socks. We are going to have to put shoe laces in the shoes which defeats the purpose of the slip on.

Cuando caminas se siente cómo el aire pasa atraves de tus tennis, o sea que sí tiene el supuesto filtro de aire. Los he usado en montaña, camino rudo y terracería y en todo momento me han demostrado ser muy resistentes. Los he torcido al caminar (accidentalmente) y en ningún momento han mostrado señal de despegarse o desgarrarse. Los colores son muy vivos y se ven de buena calidad para el precio que tienen. Tampoco se ven uff, l o s  t e n n i s, no, pero sí se ven ""de mejor gama que la media"".Lo que dicen de que hay que pedirlos media talla de la que eres para que te queden bien, es verdad. yo soy 7 y los pedí 6.5. Me quedaron a la medida, eso sí, si quieres que te sobre un poco de espacio entonces no te recomiendo hacer eso y pídelo tal cual tu número.  Mi PERO es que son extremadamente resbaladizos en cemento o piedra mojada. La suela parece un jabón cuando llueve. Iba a comprarlos otra vez, pero ya no.

They aren't quite in the Ecco category for comfort and form fit, but a good alternate shoe especially for the price.

I would recommend them for the price and for going to the pool or around town where you don’t have to worry about scuffing them.

   Shoes looks exactly as advertised.Dismiss the marking on the white part of the shoes, I spilled something on them. These shoes are comfortable and fit just right; there is no sliding around or slipping off my feet, not too tight either, no chafing. I like to quickly slip them on when I need to run out the door grab my contact free delivery (SkipTheDishes or DoorDash), take the garbage/recycle/compost out to the curb, waking around the yard and maybe some light garden work.They seem very durable, yet very flexible. That said the red part of the shoe is so flexible that if you’re  in a hurry and ramming your foot into the shoes…the heel part will fold under your heel if the shoe just fit. They are comfortable to wear as slip-ons with the back of the shoe squished under your heel but if you want to wear as a regular shoe, making the adjustment using your finger or wiggling your foot is quick and easy.",Reviewed in Canada on 28 July 2021
